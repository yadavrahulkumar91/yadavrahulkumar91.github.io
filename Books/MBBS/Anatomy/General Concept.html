        <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on Down syndrome?</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. Individuals with Down syndrome may also have physical characteristics such as a small stature, upward slanting eyes, and a single crease across the center of the palm. The severity of Down syndrome varies widely among individuals, but most people with Down syndrome can lead fulfilling lives with proper medical care and educational support.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">How does trisomy occur? Explain the clinical features of trisomy 21.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in every cell of the body. This extra genetic material causes developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and physical characteristics such as a small stature, upward slanting eyes, and a single crease across the center of the palm. Trisomy 21 is caused by a random error during cell division in the early stages of fetal development, and is not usually inherited from parents. However, the risk of having a child with trisomy 21 increases with maternal age. Prenatal testing is available to detect trisomy 21 during pregnancy.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on:</h2>
  <h3 class="qa-subquestion">(a) Intramembraneous ossification</h3>
  <p class="qa-answer">Intramembranous ossification is the process by which bone tissue is formed directly from mesenchymal connective tissue. This process occurs during the development of flat bones, such as those in the skull, and involves the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, which secrete bone matrix and initiate calcification. The resulting bone tissue is arranged in layers called lamellae, and blood vessels and nerves penetrate the bone tissue through canaliculi.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the histology of compact bone with a suitable diagram.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Compact bone, also known as cortical bone, is a dense and hard type of bone tissue that forms the outer layer of bones. It is composed of osteons, which are cylindrical structures made up of concentric layers of bone tissue called lamellae. Each osteon contains a central canal, known as the Haversian canal, which contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The canaliculi, which are small channels, connect the Haversian canals and allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the osteocytes. The diagram below illustrates the histological features of compact bone.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on: Development of long bone.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Long bones develop from cartilage models during fetal development through a process called endochondral ossification. This involves the gradual replacement of the cartilage model by bone tissue. The process begins with the formation of a cartilage model, which is gradually replaced by bone tissue beginning at the primary center of ossification in the diaphysis, or shaft, of the bone. Secondary centers of ossification form in the epiphyses, or ends, of the bone. The growth of long bones occurs at the epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage at the junction of the diaphysis and epiphysis, which is gradually replaced by bone tissue during development.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on: Intramembranous ossification.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Intramembranous ossification is the process by which bone tissue forms directly within mesenchymal tissue, without a cartilage intermediate. This process occurs primarily in the flat bones of the skull, as well as in the clavicles and some facial bones. It involves the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, which deposit mineralized bone matrix around themselves to form bone tissue. As the bone tissue grows, blood vessels invade the area, bringing with them osteoclasts, which resorb bone tissue to shape the bone and create marrow spaces.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the histology of compact bone with a suitable diagram.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Compact bone tissue, also known as cortical bone, is a dense and strong type of bone tissue that forms the outer layer of most bones. It is composed of numerous cylindrical units called osteons, or Haversian systems, which run parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of concentric lamellae, or layers, of mineralized bone matrix surrounding a central Haversian canal that contains blood vessels and nerves. Between the lamellae are small spaces called lacunae, which house mature bone cells called osteocytes. Canaliculi, or small channels, connect the lacunae and allow osteocytes to communicate with each other and with the central Haversian canal. The diagram below illustrates the basic structure of an osteon within compact bone tissue.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the microscopic anatomy of bone.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The microscopic anatomy of bone consists of two main types of tissue: compact bone and cancellous bone. Compact bone is the dense outer layer of bone that gives bones their strength and protection. Cancellous bone, also known as spongy bone, is the inner layer of bone that contains small, interconnected spaces filled with bone marrow. Within compact bone, there are microscopic units called osteons that consist of concentric rings of bone tissue called lamellae, which surround a central canal that contains blood vessels and nerves. Between the osteons are small spaces called lacunae that house bone cells called osteocytes, which are connected to each other by tiny channels called canaliculi. These structures work together to maintain the strength and vitality of the bone.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">What is fertilization? Write short notes on result of fertilization.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Fertilization is the process by which a sperm cell from a male fuses with an egg cell from a female to form a zygote, which is the first cell of a new organism. During fertilization, the genetic material from the sperm and the egg combine to create a unique genetic makeup for the zygote. This genetic information determines the physical and biological characteristics of the organism that develops from the zygote. The result of fertilization is the formation of a zygote that undergoes cell division and eventually develops into an embryo.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe briefly on formation of blastocyst.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The blastocyst is a structure that forms during the early stages of embryonic development, typically around five to six days after fertilization. It is formed when the zygote undergoes multiple rounds of cell division to form a hollow ball of cells with an inner cell mass and an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast. The inner cell mass will eventually develop into the embryo, while the trophoblast will form the placenta and other supportive structures. The blastocyst is an important stage in embryonic development because it is the stage at which the embryo implants into the uterus and begins to receive nutrients from the mother.</p>

It gives rise to various structures and tissues in the developing embryo, including the notochord, somites, and mesodermal derivatives such as the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. The somites further differentiate into sclerotome (gives rise to vertebrae and ribs), myotome (gives rise to muscles), and dermatome (gives rise to dermis of the skin). The intraembryonic mesoderm also contributes to the formation of the body wall, limbs, and connective tissue.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">List the derivatives of ectoderm.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The ectoderm is one of the three germ layers that form during gastrulation in the developing embryo. It gives rise to various structures and tissues, including the skin, hair, nails, nervous system, and sensory organs. The derivatives of ectoderm include the epidermis, hair, nails, sweat glands, mammary glands, enamel of teeth, neural tube (forms the brain and spinal cord), neural crest cells (give rise to various tissues including sensory ganglia, adrenal medulla, and pigment cells), and sensory organs such as the eye and ear.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Give a brief overview of the embryonic period/ Period of Organogenesis.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The embryonic period, also known as the period of organogenesis, is the second period of prenatal development that lasts from the end of the germinal period to the end of the eighth week after fertilization. During this period, the major organs and organ systems of the body are formed, and the embryo takes on a recognizable human form. The embryonic period is characterized by rapid cell division, migration, and differentiation of cells to form the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and their derivatives. The heart begins to beat, and the major organ systems including the nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, digestive system, and urinary system start to form. Teratogens, such as drugs, alcohol, and infections, can cause significant damage to developing organs and lead to congenital abnormalities.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the structure of mature placenta. List the different types of abnormal placenta.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The mature placenta is an organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall, allowing for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the maternal and fetal circulatory systems. It consists of two main layers: the maternal side, which is formed by the uterine wall, and the fetal side, which is formed by the chorionic plate. The placenta also contains various structures such as chorionic villi, which increase the surface area available for exchange between maternal and fetal blood. 
Abnormal placenta can be classified into various types such as:

Placenta previa: when the placenta is situated over the cervical opening, which can cause severe bleeding during delivery.
Placenta accreta: when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, which can cause heavy bleeding during delivery and may require surgical intervention.
Placental abruption: when the placenta separates from the uterine wall prematurely, which can cause fetal distress and heavy bleeding in the mother.</p>

<h3>Physiology</h3>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Give a suitable example of negative feedback mechanism.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">An example of negative feedback mechanism is the regulation of blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels increase, insulin is released from the pancreas which promotes the uptake of glucose by cells and the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver. This causes a decrease in blood glucose levels, which in turn decreases the release of insulin. This feedback loop helps to maintain stable blood glucose levels within the body.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Body fluid compartments functions of electrolytes</h2>
  <h3 class="qa-subquestion">1) Name body fluid compartments.</h3>
  <p class="qa-answer">The body is composed of two main fluid compartments: the intracellular fluid compartment (ICF) and the extracellular fluid compartment (ECF). The ECF is further divided into interstitial fluid and plasma.</p>
  <h3 class="qa-subquestion">2) Define isotonic solution. Discuss the role of ionic channels in cellular function.</h3>
  <p class="qa-answer">An isotonic solution is a solution that has the same concentration of solutes as the solution it is compared to. Ionic channels are pore-forming proteins that allow ions to move across cell membranes. These channels play a critical role in maintaining the ionic balance of cells and are involved in numerous cellular functions including electrical signaling, muscle contraction, and secretion. Dysfunction of ionic channels can lead to a variety of diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on active transport across cell membrane.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Active transport is a process that allows the movement of substances across the cell membrane against their concentration gradient, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, with the help of energy in the form of ATP. Active transport occurs through protein channels called pumps, which use the energy provided by ATP to move the substances across the membrane. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by cells in the intestine and kidney, and the movement of ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium across the membrane of nerve and muscle cells.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Define equilibrium potential and explain the ionic basis of action potential of a neuron.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Equilibrium potential is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of ions across the membrane, and it is determined by the concentration gradient and the electrical gradient of the ions. The ionic basis of action potential in a neuron is due to the movement of ions across the cell membrane, which results in a change in membrane potential. During the resting state, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged relative to the outside, with a resting potential of about -70 mV. When a stimulus is applied, sodium ions enter the cell, causing depolarization of the membrane potential. This depolarization triggers the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell, and a reversal of membrane potential. This is followed by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, leading to the efflux of potassium ions from the cell, and repolarization of the membrane potential to the resting state. The ionic basis of action potential ensures the transmission of electrical signals in neurons.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Draw a labeled diagram of action potential of a neuron and explain its ionic basis. Explain the refractory period.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The action potential of a neuron can be represented by a graph of the changes in membrane potential over time. The diagram includes three main phases: the resting state, depolarization, and repolarization. During the resting state, the membrane potential is about -70 mV. When a stimulus is applied, sodium channels open, causing an influx of sodium ions into the cell, leading to depolarization of the membrane potential. This depolarization triggers the opening of more sodium channels, leading to a rapid influx of sodium ions, and a reversal of membrane potential. This is followed by the opening of potassium channels, leading to the efflux of potassium ions, and repolarization of the membrane potential to the resting state. The refractory period is a period of time after the initiation of an action potential when the neuron is unable to generate another action potential. This is due to the inactivation of sodium channels during depolarization and repolarization. The refractory period ensures that the action potential propagates in one direction and prevents the neuron from generating a continuous stream of action potentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Define the term resting membrane potential, Nernst potential, Refractory period and Chronaxie. Mention the ionic basis of nerve action potential.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Resting membrane potential is the electrical potential difference between the inside and the outside of the cell membrane of a resting neuron. Nernst potential is the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane when the ion movement reaches equilibrium. Refractory period is a period of time after a neuron has fired an action potential where it is less likely to fire another action potential. Chronaxie is the minimum duration of a current of twice the strength of the rheobase needed to excite a nerve fiber. The ionic basis of nerve action potential is the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane, which causes a change in electrical potential and triggers the release of neurotransmitters.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Define all or none law.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The all or none law states that when a neuron fires an action potential, it does so at full strength or not at all. If the stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold potential, an action potential will be generated, but if the stimulus is too weak, the neuron will not fire.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on:</h2>
  <h3 class="qa-subquestion">Diagram of action potential of neuron and its ionic basis.</h3>
  <p class="qa-answer">An action potential is a rapid and brief change in the membrane potential of a neuron. It consists of depolarization, repolarization, and a brief hyperpolarization phase. The ionic basis of action potential involves the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. During depolarization, sodium ions enter the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more positive. This is followed by repolarization, where potassium ions exit the cell and the membrane potential returns to its resting value. The brief hyperpolarization phase occurs when potassium ions continue to leave the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more negative than the resting potential before it returns to its resting value.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Mention the differences between action potential and graded potential.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Action potential is a rapid and brief all-or-none depolarization of the membrane potential of excitable cells, including neurons and muscle cells, that travels along the length of the cell. It has a fixed amplitude, duration, and threshold, and is triggered by a depolarizing stimulus that reaches the threshold potential. Graded potential, on the other hand, is a slower and smaller change in the membrane potential that can be either depolarizing (excitatory) or hyperpolarizing (inhibitory), depending on the type and strength of the stimulus. It has a variable amplitude, duration, and threshold, and does not propagate along the cell. </p>

b) Spatial summation: Spatial summation is the process by which multiple graded potentials generated at different synapses on a neuron are integrated to produce a larger depolarization that can reach the threshold for generating an action potential. The integration of graded potentials depends on the location and timing of the synapses, as well as the strength and type of the signals they generate. Spatial summation can be either additive, in which the depolarizations are simply summed up, or inhibitory, in which the depolarizations cancel each other out.

c) Temporal summation: Temporal summation is the process by which multiple graded potentials generated at the same synapse on a neuron are integrated to produce a larger depolarization that can reach the threshold for generating an action potential. The integration of graded potentials depends on the frequency and duration of the signals, as well as the strength and type of the signals they generate. Temporal summation can be either additive, in which the depolarizations are simply summed up over time, or inhibitory, in which the depolarizations cancel each other out over time.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the clinical significance of plasma half life of a drug.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Plasma half life of a drug refers to the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the plasma to decrease by 50%. This parameter is important because it determines the duration of action of the drug, and also influences the dosing frequency required to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug. A drug with a short half life will need to be administered more frequently than a drug with a long half life. Additionally, a long half life may increase the risk of drug accumulation and toxicity, while a short half life may lead to subtherapeutic levels of the drug. Therefore, understanding the plasma half life of a drug is important for optimizing its therapeutic use and avoiding adverse effects.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">List microsomal enzyme induces and inhibitors. What are the purposes achieved by biotransformation?</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Microsomal enzyme inducers include drugs such as phenobarbital, rifampin, and carbamazepine, while inhibitors include drugs such as cimetidine, erythromycin, and ketoconazole. Biotransformation, which is the process by which drugs are metabolized and transformed in the body, serves several purposes. These include converting lipophilic drugs into more hydrophilic forms that can be excreted by the kidneys, inactivating drugs to reduce toxicity, and activating prodrugs to increase their effectiveness. Additionally, biotransformation can lead to drug interactions by altering the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that are metabolized by the same enzymes.</p>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the plasma protein binding of drugs. Describe its clinical significance with suitable examples.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Many drugs bind to plasma proteins, particularly albumin, in the blood. This binding can affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug by reducing its free concentration and increasing its half life. It can also affect drug interactions, as drugs that compete for the same binding sites on plasma proteins may displace each other and alter their pharmacokinetics. Examples of drugs that are highly protein-bound include warfarin and phenytoin. In some cases, changes in protein binding can lead to altered drug response or toxicity. For example, in patients with hypoalbuminemia, there may be an increased risk of toxicity with highly protein-bound drugs because of their increased free concentrations in the blood. Therefore, understanding the plasma protein binding of drugs is important for optimizing their therapeutic use and avoiding adverse effects.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Mention the different types of shock. Discuss the pathogenesis of septic shock.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">There are different types of shock, including hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, neurogenic shock, and septic shock. Septic shock occurs when an infection leads to a systemic inflammatory response that results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and hypotension. This can cause inadequate tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and ultimately, multiple organ failure. The pathogenesis of septic shock involves the release of bacterial endotoxins and cytokines, which trigger the inflammatory response. The inflammatory mediators cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and activation of coagulation and complement pathways. The resulting hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">List the causes of edema. Describe briefly the pathogenesis of edema.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Edema can be caused by various factors, including increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic pressure, lymphatic obstruction, and increased capillary permeability. The pathogenesis of edema involves an imbalance between the forces that regulate fluid movement across the capillary wall. Under normal circumstances, there is a balance between the hydrostatic pressure, which tends to push fluid out of the capillaries, and the oncotic pressure, which tends to pull fluid into the capillaries. However, when there is an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure or a decrease in oncotic pressure, fluid accumulates in the interstitial space, leading to edema. Additionally, if the lymphatic system is unable to drain the interstitial fluid, it can also contribute to edema formation.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the pathway of glycolysis with energy release in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP. The pathway of glycolysis involves ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which are divided into two stages: the energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase. In the energy investment phase, two ATP molecules are used to phosphorylate glucose, which is then converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In the energy payoff phase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules, which are further metabolized to produce ATP, NADH, and pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the TCA cycle, which generates more ATP. However, in the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted to lactate through the process of fermentation, which produces ATP but at a much lower rate. The energy yield in aerobic conditions is higher, producing 38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, while anaerobic conditions produce only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on Post-Transcriptional Modification.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Post-transcriptional modification refers to the various changes that occur to the primary transcript of RNA after it is transcribed from DNA. This process is important for the maturation of RNA molecules into their final functional form. The modifications include splicing, capping, and polyadenylation. Splicing involves the removal of introns and joining of exons to generate mature mRNA. Capping refers to the addition of a methylated guanine cap at the 5' end of mRNA, while polyadenylation involves the addition of a string of adenine nucleotides at the 3' end of mRNA. These modifications play a crucial role in the stability, transport, and translation of mRNA.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on Translation.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Translation is the process by which the genetic code carried by mRNA is decoded to produce a sequence of amino acids that form a protein. The process occurs on ribosomes, which are composed of rRNA and protein. During translation, the ribosome reads the codons on the mRNA and matches them with the appropriate tRNA molecule that carries the corresponding amino acid. The amino acids are then joined together through peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain. The process continues until a stop codon is reached, at which point the protein is released from the ribosome. Translation is a highly regulated process that involves various factors, including initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">What are the characteristics of the genetic code?</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The genetic code is a set of rules that determines how the nucleotide sequence of mRNA is translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein. Some of the characteristics of the genetic code include: 
  <ul>
    <li>The code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid.</li>
    <li>The code is universal, meaning that it is the same in all living organisms.</li>
    <li>The code is non-overlapping, meaning that each nucleotide is part of only one codon.</li>
    <li>The code is commaless, meaning that there are no gaps or punctuation between codons.</li>
    <li>The code is read in a specific direction, starting from the 5' end and ending at the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the steps of PCR and mention its application in the diagnosis of a disease.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a technique used to amplify DNA sequences in vitro. It involves three main steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. 
    During the denaturation step, the DNA sample is heated to a high temperature to separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands. 
    In the annealing step, the temperature is lowered to allow primers (short sequences of DNA that are complementary to the target sequence) to anneal to the single-stranded DNA. 
    In the extension step, the temperature is raised again and a DNA polymerase enzyme extends the primers, resulting in the synthesis of new complementary strands of DNA. 
    This process is repeated multiple times, with each cycle doubling the amount of target DNA. 
    PCR has many applications, including the diagnosis of genetic diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. It can be used to detect the presence of a pathogen in a patient's blood or tissue sample by amplifying a specific sequence of the pathogen's DNA.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write on Robert Koch's contributions in Medical microbiology.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Robert Koch is considered one of the founding fathers of medical microbiology. He was a German physician who made significant contributions to the field of microbiology in the late 19th century. Koch is best known for his work in establishing the germ theory of disease, which states that many diseases are caused by microorganisms. He also developed the techniques for pure culture isolation and identification of bacteria, which are still used today. Koch's postulates, a set of guidelines for establishing the causative relationship between a microbe and a disease, are still considered the gold standard for proving the etiology of infectious diseases. Koch's work laid the foundation for modern microbiology and helped to revolutionize the field of medicine.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes: (2.5) Koch's postulates</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Koch's postulates are a set of guidelines developed by Robert Koch for establishing the causative relationship between a microbe and a disease. The postulates include four criteria: 1) the microorganism must be present in all cases of the disease, 2) the microorganism must be isolated from the diseased host and grown in pure culture, 3) the cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy host, and 4) the same microorganism should be re-isolated from the experimentally infected host. Koch's postulates have been widely used to establish the etiology of many infectious diseases, and are still considered the gold standard for proving the causative relationship between a microbe and a disease.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the beneficial and harmful roles of normal flora. [5]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Normal flora refers to the microorganisms that live on or inside the human body without causing disease. They play several beneficial roles, such as aiding in digestion, producing vitamins, and preventing the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. However, they can also cause harm if they overgrow or if they enter areas of the body where they are not normally found, such as the urinary tract or bloodstream. Overgrowth of normal flora can lead to infections, such as bacterial vaginosis or yeast infections, while introduction of normal flora into abnormal areas of the body can lead to infections or other complications. Therefore, maintaining a balance of normal flora is essential for good health.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write the principle of Gram's stain. Give any two examples of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Gram's stain is a differential staining technique used to differentiate bacterial species into two groups based on the differences in their cell walls. The principle of Gram's stain is to first apply crystal violet to the bacteria, followed by iodine, which locks the stain into the cell wall. The bacteria are then decolorized with alcohol, and finally counterstained with safranin. Gram positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain, while gram negative bacteria lose the crystal violet stain and take up the counterstain. Examples of gram positive bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, while examples of gram negative bacteria include Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Viruses are small infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. They are acellular and lack the machinery for protein synthesis. The general properties of viruses include a simple structure with a nucleic acid core (either DNA or RNA), surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. Some viruses also have an outer envelope derived from the host cell membrane. Examples of viruses causing encephalitis include herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Describe primary and secondary immune responses.</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The primary immune response is the initial immune response to an antigen. When an antigen enters the body for the first time, it is recognized as foreign by the immune system, and B cells and T cells are activated to produce antibodies and eliminate the antigen. The primary response takes time to develop, usually 7-10 days, and the antibody levels are relatively low.
The secondary immune response occurs when the immune system encounters the same antigen for a second time. Memory B cells and T cells that were generated during the primary response are quickly activated and start producing antibodies. The secondary response is much faster and stronger than the primary response, with higher levels of antibodies produced. The secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which provides long-term protection against re-infection with the same pathogen.</p>
