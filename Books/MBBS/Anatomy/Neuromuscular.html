      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the pathways followed by corticospinal tract. Enumerate the clinical features due
        to its lesion.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The corticospinal tract is the primary motor pathway for voluntary movement. It originates in
        the motor cortex of the brain, descends through the internal capsule, and then travels through the brainstem and
        spinal cord. The corticospinal tract is divided into the lateral corticospinal tract and the ventral
        corticospinal
        tract. The lateral corticospinal tract crosses over to the opposite side of the body at the level of the medulla
        oblongata, while the ventral corticospinal tract remains ipsilateral.
        Clinical features of a corticospinal tract lesion include spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign.
        Spastic paralysis is characterized by increased muscle tone and difficulty initiating movement, while
        hyperreflexia refers to an overactive reflex response. The Babinski sign is a reflex in which the big toe
        extends
        and the other toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stimulated. In a corticospinal tract lesion, this reflex
        becomes pathological and is present even in adults.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define Tract. Trace out the pathway for pain and temperature.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">In the nervous system, a tract refers to a bundle of nerve fibers that have a common origin
        and
        destination. Tracts are classified based on their function and location in the nervous system.
        The pathway for pain and temperature begins with the detection of these stimuli by specialized sensory receptors
        in the skin. The nerve fibers from these receptors synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the
        spinal cord. The second-order neurons then decussate, or cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord, and
        ascend through the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus.

        In the thalamus, the third-order neurons receive the sensory input and project to the primary somatosensory
        cortex
        in the parietal lobe. Here, the sensory information is processed and integrated to give rise to the sensation of
        pain or temperature. </p>

      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">In a transverse section of the spinal cord, the important ascending tracts include the dorsal
        column-medial lemniscus tract and the spinothalamic tract. The dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract carries the
        fine touch, vibration and proprioception sensations, while the spinothalamic tract carries pain and temperature
        sensations. The peripheral receptor sends the sensory signals through the dorsal roots of the spinal cord, which
        then synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn. The second-order neurons decussate to the opposite
        side
        and ascend the spinal cord through the dorsal columns to synapse with third-order neurons in the ventral
        posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. From there, the sensory information is sent to the primary sensory
        cortex

      <p class="qa-answer">The medulla oblongata is the lowermost part of the brainstem that connects the brain to the
        spinal cord. It is approximately 3 cm long and extends from the foramen magnum to the pontomedullary junction.
        The
        external features of the medulla oblongata include the pyramids, olives, and the fourth ventricle. The pyramids
        are two longitudinal ridges that contain the corticospinal tracts, which are responsible for motor function. The
        olives are oval-shaped structures that contain the inferior olivary nucleus, which is involved in motor
        coordination. The fourth ventricle is a diamond-shaped cavity located between the cerebellum and the brainstem.
      </p>
      <p class="qa-answer">The medulla oblongata contains many important nuclei, including the nucleus gracilis and
        nucleus cuneatus, which receive the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract, and the solitary nucleus, which
        receives
        the visceral sensory information. Other nuclei include the hypoglossal nucleus, which controls the tongue
        muscles,
        the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which controls the parasympathetic nervous system, and the
        vestibular

        the granule cell layer. The Purkinje cells are the largest neurons in the cerebellar cortex and are arranged in
        a
        single layer between the molecular and granule cell layers. The granule cells are the smallest neurons in the
        cerebellum and are located in the granule cell layer. The white matter of the cerebellum contains myelinated

        and
        synapse directly onto Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. The cerebellum sends efferent fibers to two main
        targets: the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and the thalamus. The fibers that project to the vestibular
        nuclei
        are involved in the maintenance of balance and coordination of eye movements, while the fibers that project to

        <p class="qa-answer">The auditory pathway is responsible for processing sound information and transmitting it
          from
          the ear to the brain. It starts with the outer ear, which captures sound waves and directs them into the ear
          canal. The sound waves then travel to the middle ear, where they vibrate the eardrum and the ossicles, three
          small bones that amplify the vibrations. These vibrations are then transmitted to the inner ear, where they
          stimulate hair cells in the cochlea, a snail-shaped structure. The hair cells convert the mechanical
          vibrations
          into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve
          synapses in the cochlear nucleus of the brainstem, and from there, the auditory information is relayed to
          various brain regions, including the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and the auditory
          cortex

        <h2 class="qa-question">6) Trace the visual pathway and correlate with different types of Anopias.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The visual pathway is responsible for processing visual information and transmitting it
          from
          the eyes to the brain. It starts with the retina, where light is converted into electrical signals by
          photoreceptor cells. These signals are transmitted to the bipolar cells, which in turn transmit them to the
          ganglion cells. The axons of the ganglion cells converge at the optic disc, where they form the optic nerve.
          The
          optic nerve carries the visual information from the eye to the brain. The optic nerve fibers from both eyes
          then
          join at the optic chiasm, where they partially cross over to the opposite side of the brain. The fibers that
          originate from the nasal retina cross over, while the fibers that originate from the temporal retina do not
          cross over. The fibers then continue on as the optic tract and terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus in
          the thalamus. From there, the visual information is transmitted to the primary visual cortex in the occipital
          lobe.
          Different types of anopias can occur depending on where along the visual pathway the damage occurs. For
          example,
          damage to the optic nerve can result in monocular blindness, while damage to the optic chiasm can result in
          bitemporal hemianopia. Lesions in the optic tract or lateral geniculate nucleus can result in homonymous
          hemianopia, where the loss of vision affects one side of the visual field in both eyes.</p>

          course, extracranial course and its's branches. Also mention the efferent of facial nerve lesions.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The facial nerve is the seventh cranial nerve and has both sensory and motor components. It
          originates from the brainstem and has a complex intracranial and extracranial course.
          Intracranially, the facial nerve arises from the pons and has motor, sensory, and parasympathetic fibers. The
          motor fibers innervate the muscles of facial expression, while the sensory fibers transmit taste information
          from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The parasympathetic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland,
          submandibular gland, and sublingual gland.

          Extracranially, the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland,
          where it branches into five main branches: temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical. The
          temporal branch supplies the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles. The zygomatic branch supplies the
          orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus muscles. The buccal branch supplies the buccinator muscle and the upper lip
          muscles. The marginal mandibular branch supplies the muscles of the lower lip and chin. The cervical branch
          supplies the platysma muscle.

          Lesions of the facial nerve can result in a variety of efferents, depending on the location and extent of the
          lesion. If the lesion occurs in the intracranial portion of the nerve, it can result in facial paralysis, loss
          of taste sensation, and dry eyes due to decreased tear production. If the lesion occurs in the extracranial
          portion of the nerve, it can result in weakness or paralysis of the muscles of facial expression on the
          affected
          side of the face, drooping of the corner of the mouth, and difficulty closing the eye. Lesions can also cause
          hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) and loss of the corneal reflex (the normal blinking response to a
          touch on the cornea).

        <h3 class="qa-subquestion">Axonal transport</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">Axonal transport is the process by which materials are transported along the length of an
          axon, the long extension of a neuron. There are two main types of axonal transport: anterograde transport,
          which
          moves materials from the cell body toward the axon terminal, and retrograde transport, which moves materials
          from the axon terminal toward the cell body. This transport occurs along microtubules and is mediated by motor
          proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, which carry cargo along the microtubules. Axonal transport is essential
          for the maintenance and function of neurons, as it allows for the transport of important molecules
          such as proteins, lipids, and organelles, to and from the cell body and axon terminal. For example,
          neurotransmitters and their associated enzymes are synthesized in the cell body and must be transported down
          the
          axon to the terminal where they can be released into the synapse. Similarly, mitochondria, which are
          responsible
          for producing ATP, must be transported to the site of energy consumption in the axon terminal. Axonal
          transport
          can be disrupted in certain neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the accumulation of toxic proteins and
          organelles and contributing to the degeneration of neurons.

          makes it harder for the neuron to generate an action potential. It occurs when inhibitory neurotransmitters
          bind
          to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing an influx of negatively charged ions (such as Cl-) or an
          efflux
          of positively charged ions (such as K+). This makes the inside of the neuron more negative or the outside more
          positive, reducing the likelihood of an action potential being generated.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">Define the following:</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">a) Neurotransmitter: A neurotransmitter is a chemical substance that is released from a
          neuron in response to an action potential and acts on a target cell to transmit a signal. It can excite or
          inhibit the target cell and can be either stored in vesicles or synthesized on demand.<br>
          b) EPSP: EPSP stands for excitatory postsynaptic potential, which is a type of synaptic potential that makes
          it
          easier for the neuron to generate an action potential. It occurs when excitatory neurotransmitters bind to

          the
          inside of the neuron more positive.<br>
          c) Excitatory synaptic transmission: Excitatory synaptic transmission is a process in which an action
          potential
          in the presynaptic neuron leads to the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, which bind
          to

        <h2 class="qa-question">Differences between local potential and action potential.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Local potentials are graded changes in membrane potential that occur in response to
          neurotransmitter binding or sensory stimuli. They can be either depolarizing (EPSP) or hyperpolarizing (IPSP)
          and are conducted decrementally, meaning they lose strength as they travel along the neuron. They can also
          summate, meaning multiple inputs can add together to reach the threshold for an action potential. In contrast,
          action potentials are all-or-nothing events that occur when the membrane potential reaches a certain
          threshold.
          They are conducted without decrement and have a fixed amplitude and duration. They also involve the opening
          and
          closing of voltage-gated ion channels and require a large influx of Na+ followed by an efflux of K+ to

        <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a specialized junction between two nerve cells or between a nerve cell and its
          target, where electrical or chemical signals are transmitted. There are four stages in synaptic transmission:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Presynaptic events:</strong> Action potentials arrive at the presynaptic terminal, resulting in
            the
            opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and the influx of calcium ions into the terminal.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurotransmitter release:</strong> The calcium influx triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles
            with
            the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.</li>
          <li><strong>Postsynaptic events:</strong> The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and
            bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to the opening or closing of ion channels and the
            generation of a postsynaptic potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The neurotransmitter is either taken back up into the presynaptic terminal
            or
            broken down by enzymes in the synaptic cleft.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Synaptic inhibition is a process by which the transmission of signals across a synapse is decreased. It can
          occur through various mechanisms, such as presynaptic inhibition, where the release of neurotransmitter from
          the
          presynaptic terminal is reduced, or postsynaptic inhibition, where the responsiveness of the postsynaptic cell
          to the neurotransmitter is decreased.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a junction between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector cell, such
          as
          a muscle or gland. There are two main types of synapses: chemical synapses and electrical synapses. Chemical
          synapses are more common and involve the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron, which bind
          to
          receptors on the postsynaptic neuron or effector cell. Electrical synapses are less common and involve the
          direct transfer of electrical signals between the cells through gap junctions.
          The steps of synaptic transmission are:

          Action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal
          Calcium ions enter the presynaptic terminal
          Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft
          Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron or effector cell
          Ion channels open, leading to a change in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell
          Neurotransmitters are either broken down or taken back up by the presynaptic neuron for recycling
          Renshaw cell inhibition is a type of inhibitory feedback circuit that involves the release of glycine from
          Renshaw cells in the spinal cord. When a motor neuron fires, it activates a Renshaw cell, which then releases
          glycine onto the motor neuron's dendrites. This causes the motor neuron to be inhibited, preventing excessive
          contraction of the muscle it innervates.</p>

          constricts the bronchioles in the lungs and increases the secretions of mucus in the respiratory tract.
          Parasympathetic stimulation of the intestine increases the motility and secretion of the digestive system. It
          also causes constriction of the pupils in the eyes and accommodation for near vision. In the urinary bladder,
          parasympathetic stimulation promotes contraction of the bladder wall and relaxation of the sphincter muscle,
          leading to urination. In the penis, parasympathetic stimulation causes vasodilation and increased blood flow,
          leading to erection.</p>

          affecting
          different system of the body?</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Sympathetic discharge prepares the individual for the flight and fright response by
          increasing heart rate and cardiac output, dilating the airways in the lungs to increase oxygen supply,
          increasing blood glucose levels, and decreasing digestive activity. It also causes pupil dilation for improved
          vision, increases sweat production for cooling, and redirects blood flow to the skeletal muscles.
          Additionally,
          sympathetic discharge can cause piloerection, where the hair on the skin stands up, creating insulation, and
          potentially making an individual look larger and more intimidating.</p>

          <b>a) Sympathetic innervations:</b> Sympathetic innervation refers to the activation of the sympathetic
          nervous
          system to stimulate an organ or tissue. For example, sympathetic innervation of the heart increases heart rate
          and contractility, while sympathetic innervation of the blood vessels causes vasoconstriction, which increases
          blood pressure.
          <b>b) Neuroendocrine reflex:</b> Neuroendocrine reflex is a type of reflex where a stimulus triggers the
          release
          of hormones from an endocrine gland. For example, the suckling of a baby's mouth during breastfeeding triggers
          the release of oxytocin from the pituitary gland, which causes contraction of the smooth muscles of the
          breast,

        <p class="qa-answer">Sympathetic discharge prepares the individual for fight and fright by activating the
          sympathetic nervous system. This results in the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline, which cause an
          increase
          in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Blood flow is redirected to the skeletal muscles, brain,
          and heart, while it is reduced to the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Glucose is released from the
          liver, providing energy for the body. The pupils dilate to improve vision, and sweat production increases to
          regulate body temperature. These responses allow the body to be better equipped to handle the perceived

        <p class="qa-answer">
          a) <strong>Synapse:</strong> A synapse is a junction between two nerve cells or between a nerve cell and an
          effector cell, where information is transmitted from one cell to the other through the release and reception
          of
          neurotransmitters. An example of a synapse is the neuromuscular junction, where a motor neuron communicates
          with
          a muscle cell to produce muscle contraction.
          vbnet
          Copy code
          b) <strong>Motor unit:</strong> A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates.
          When the motor neuron is activated, all the muscle fibers in its motor unit contract together. An example of a
          motor unit is the group of muscle fibers controlled by a single motor neuron in the biceps brachii muscle.

          c) <strong>Tetanus:</strong> Tetanus is a sustained contraction of a muscle caused by repeated stimulation of
          the motor neurons that innervate it. An example of tetanus is the lockjaw caused by the bacterial infection of
          Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that causes uncontrolled muscle contractions.

          d) <strong>Neurotransmitter:</strong> A neurotransmitter is a chemical substance released by a neuron at a
          synapse, which binds to receptors on the target cell and modulates its activity. An example of a
          neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which is released by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction to
          activate
          muscle contraction.

          located in the cerebral cortex or the descending pathways from the brainstem to the spinal cord. The
          physiological basis of hyperreflexia and hypertonia in upper motor neuron lesion is due to the loss of
          inhibitory input from the damaged upper motor neurons on the lower motor neurons. This leads to an increase in

        <h2 class="qa-question">Illustrate withdrawal reflex as polysynaptic reflex arc.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The withdrawal reflex is a polysynaptic reflex arc that is responsible for removing a limb
          from a painful or potentially damaging stimulus. The reflex arc involves sensory neurons that detect the
          painful
          stimulus, interneurons that integrate the sensory input, and motor neurons that cause the muscles to contract
          and move the limb away from the stimulus. The polysynaptic nature of the reflex arc allows for a more rapid

        <h2 class="qa-question">Trace the pathway for pain sensation from receptor in the skin and brain.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Pain sensation begins with the activation of nociceptors, specialized sensory receptors
          that
          respond to noxious stimuli. Nociceptors are located in the skin and other tissues throughout the body. When a
          noxious stimulus is detected, the nociceptor sends an electrical signal through its axon to the spinal cord.
          The
          signal is transmitted across a synapse to a second-order neuron in the spinal cord, which then sends the
          signal
          up to the brain through a pathway called the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract ascends through the
          spinal cord and synapses in the thalamus, which then relays the signal to the somatosensory cortex for
          conscious
          perception of pain. In addition to the spinothalamic tract, pain signals also activate other pathways that can

          temperature information from the periphery to the brain. It is part of the anterolateral system, which also
          includes the anterior spinothalamic tract and the spinoreticular tract. The lateral spinothalamic tract is

        <p class="qa-answer">Proprioception is the sense of the position and movement of our body parts, including the
          limbs, joints, and muscles. It allows us to have awareness of our body in space without relying on vision.
          Proprioceptive information is carried by proprioceptors, which are sensory receptors located in muscles,
          tendons, and joints. The pathway for proprioception starts in the periphery and travels through the dorsal
          root
          ganglion and dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla oblongata, where it crosses over to the opposite
          side in the medullary pyramids. From there, it ascends to the thalamus and then to the primary somatosensory
          cortex for processing. A disease that damages this tract is tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of
          neurosyphilis that affects the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, leading to a loss of proprioception and

        <p class="qa-answer">Thermal sensation is carried from the periphery to the center via the spinothalamic tract.
          The spinothalamic tract is a neural pathway that transmits information about pain, temperature, and crude
          touch
          from the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain. The sensory neurons that detect thermal stimuli have free
          nerve endings that are sensitive to changes in temperature. These neurons transmit the information to the
          dorsal
          root ganglion, where the cell bodies of the sensory neurons are located. The axons of the sensory neurons
          enter
          the spinal cord and synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn. The second-order neurons cross the
          midline of the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral spinothalamic tract to the thalamus. The thalamus

        <h2 class="qa-question">1) Briefly describe the role of hypothalamus in the temperature regulation.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature by maintaining a
          balance
          between heat gain and heat loss. It acts as a thermostat and receives input from temperature-sensitive neurons
          located in the skin and organs. If the body temperature rises, the hypothalamus initiates sweating, dilation
          of
          blood vessels in the skin, and other mechanisms that promote heat loss. If the body temperature falls, the
          hypothalamus triggers shivering, constriction of blood vessels in the skin, and other mechanisms that conserve
          heat. This delicate balance is essential for maintaining a stable body temperature, which is necessary for the
          proper functioning of metabolic processes.</p>

          temperature, appetite and thirst, sleep-wake cycles, autonomic nervous system, emotional responses, and the
          release of hormones from the pituitary gland.
          Hypothalamic obesity is a type of obesity that occurs due to damage to the hypothalamus, often as a result of
          surgery or injury. It is characterized by uncontrolled weight gain, especially in the abdominal region,
          despite
          a decrease in food intake and an increase in physical activity. The basis of hypothalamic obesity lies in the
          disruption of the hypothalamus's control over appetite and metabolism. Damage to the hypothalamus can lead to
          a
          decrease in the levels of hormones that regulate hunger, such as leptin, and an increase in the levels of
          hormones that stimulate appetite, such as ghrelin. Additionally, damage to the hypothalamus can lead to a
          decrease in energy expenditure and a decrease in the body's ability to burn calories. </p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">How sensory transduction of vision takes place? Describe with a neat diagram.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Sensory transduction of vision takes place in the retina of the eye. The retina contains
          photoreceptor cells called rods and cones that are responsible for detecting light and converting it into
          electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. When light enters the eye, it is
          first
          focused by the cornea and lens onto the retina. The light then passes through several layers of cells in the
          retina before reaching the photoreceptor cells.
          The photoreceptor cells contain a protein called rhodopsin, which consists of a protein molecule called opsin
          and a light-sensitive molecule called retinal. When light hits the retinal molecule, it changes shape and
          triggers a series of chemical reactions that generate an electrical signal in the photoreceptor cell. This
          electrical signal is then transmitted to other cells in the retina and eventually to the brain, where it is
          interpreted as visual information.

          The diagram below shows a simplified version of the visual transduction pathway:</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Phototransduction is the process by which light is detected and converted into electrical
          signals in the retina of the eye. This process is carried out by photoreceptor cells called rods and cones,
          which contain light-sensitive pigments that change shape when they absorb light.
          Reflex responses mediated through the visual pathway include:

          Pupillary reflex: This is a reflex response that causes the pupils of the eye to constrict in response to
          bright
          light. This reflex is mediated by the optic nerve and involves the contraction of muscles in the iris.

          Accommodation reflex: This reflex response allows the eye to adjust its focus to see objects at different
          distances. It is mediated by the oculomotor nerve and involves the contraction of muscles in the ciliary body
          and lens of the eye.

          Optokinetic reflex: This reflex response helps to stabilize visual images during movement by causing the eyes
          to

        <h2 class="qa-question">h) Impedance matching and attenuation reflex</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Impedance matching and attenuation reflex are two important functions of the middle ear.
          Impedance matching refers to the process by which the middle ear amplifies sound vibrations to overcome the
          impedance, or resistance, of the inner ear fluids. This is necessary because the air-filled middle ear and the
          fluid-filled inner ear have different acoustic impedances. The ossicles of the middle ear act as a lever
          system
          to increase the force of the sound vibrations and reduce the impedance mismatch between the two regions.
          The attenuation reflex is a protective mechanism that reduces the amount of sound entering the inner ear when
          it
          becomes too loud. This reflex is mediated by the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles, which are attached to
          the
          ossicles. When sound levels become too high, these muscles contract to dampen the movement of the ossicles and
          reduce the amount of sound transmitted to the inner ear. This helps to protect the delicate structures of the
          inner ear from damage due to loud noises.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">Define hydrocephalus. Explain its etiopathogenesis.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
          in the ventricles of the brain, resulting in increased intracranial pressure and compression of brain tissue.
          The etiopathogenesis of hydrocephalus can be classified as either obstructive or non-obstructive.</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">Obstructive hydrocephalus occurs when there is a blockage in the flow of CSF, typically at
          the level of the ventricular system. This blockage can be caused by a variety of factors, including congenital
          abnormalities, tumors, infections, and hemorrhages.</p>
        <p class="qa-answer">Non-obstructive hydrocephalus occurs when there is an imbalance between the production and
          absorption of CSF, leading to an accumulation of fluid in the ventricles. This can be caused by a variety of
          factors, including meningitis, head trauma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Tumors of the brain can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary brain tumors
          originate
          within the brain or its coverings, while secondary brain tumors arise from cancer cells that have spread from
          other parts of the body. Schwannoma is a type of primary brain tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are
          cells that wrap around and support nerve fibers. Common sites for Schwannoma include the cranial nerves,
          particularly the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve, as well as the spinal nerves.
          Grossly, Schwannomas are well-circumscribed, encapsulated tumors that may be either cystic or solid.
          Microscopically, they are composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in interlacing bundles, with areas of
          Verocay bodies, which are acellular zones surrounded by the neoplastic cells. Schwannomas are typically benign
          tumors; however, malignant forms do exist and are associated with a poorer prognosis.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Pralidoxime is used as an antidote in poisoning with organophosphorus compounds, which are
          commonly found in insecticides and nerve agents. Organophosphorus compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase,
          leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Pralidoxime
          reactivates acetylcholinesterase by removing the phosphate group that is added by organophosphorus compounds,
          thus restoring normal cholinergic neurotransmission. However, Pralidoxime is only effective if administered
          within a few hours of exposure, as irreversible aging of the acetylcholinesterase-organophosphorus complex

        <p class="qa-answer">Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a drug of choice in the treatment of anaphylactic
          shock because it has potent vasoconstrictive and bronchodilatory effects. Anaphylactic shock is a severe
          allergic reaction that can cause widespread vasodilation and bronchoconstriction, leading to hypotension,
          respiratory distress, and potentially fatal cardiovascular collapse. Adrenaline acts on alpha-1 adrenergic
          receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure. It also acts on beta-2
          adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation and improving breathing. Additionally, adrenaline
          increases heart rate and cardiac output, which can help to maintain blood flow to vital organs. </p>

          What are their adverse effects.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that act as positive allosteric modulators of the
          gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
          system. The binding of benzodiazepines to the GABA receptor enhances the affinity of GABA for the receptor,
          leading to increased chloride ion influx into the neuron and hyperpolarization of the cell, resulting in
          anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects. Common benzodiazepines include alprazolam, clonazepam,
          diazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam. They are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, insomnia, seizures, and
          muscle spasms. Adverse effects of benzodiazepines include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, and

        <p class="qa-answer">Chlorpromazine exerts its pharmacological effects by blocking various receptors in the
          brain,
          including dopamine, serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine receptors. Specifically, it acts as a dopamine
          receptor antagonist, which results in a decrease in dopamine transmission in the brain. This leads to its
          antipsychotic effects, as excess dopamine activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis.
          Chlorpromazine also has sedative and antiemetic effects, likely due to its antagonism of histamine and
          alpha-adrenergic receptors, respectively.</p>

        <h3 class="qa-subquestion">1) Discuss the treatment of depression.</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">Depression is a common mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of
          interest or pleasure, feelings of worthlessness, and impaired functioning. Treatment for depression can
          involve
          a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy
          (IPT) are two effective forms of psychotherapy for depression. Antidepressant medications, such as selective
          serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic
          antidepressants (TCAs), can also be used to treat depression.</p>

        <h3 class="qa-subquestion">2) Give the basis of use of antidepressants.</h3>

        <p class="qa-answer">Antidepressants are used to treat depression and other related conditions, such as anxiety
          disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). They work by increasing the levels of certain
          neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, which are involved in regulating mood.
          Antidepressants can take several weeks to start working, and their effectiveness varies from person to person.
          Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are one class of antidepressant medication that are still used, although they
          have largely been replaced by newer, more selective medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. TCAs work by blocking
          the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain.</p>
        <h4 class="qa-subsubquestion">a) Tricyclic antidepressants</h4>
        <p class="qa-answer">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of antidepressant medication that were first
          developed in the 1950s. They work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing
          their availability in the brain. TCAs can be effective in treating depression, but they are associated with a
          number of adverse effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and dizziness. They can also be
          toxic in overdose. Because of these side effects, TCAs are less commonly used than newer antidepressant
          medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.</p>

          modulation of neurotransmitter release and the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Lithium is
          believed to help stabilize mood by reducing the activity of excitatory neurotransmitters and increasing the
          activity of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain.

        2. Describe the mechanism of synthesis of acetylcholine, its function and degradation at neuromuscular junction.
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron from choline and
        acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The acetylcholine is then packaged into vesicles
        and transported to the presynaptic membrane, where it can be released in response to an action potential. Once
        released, acetylcholine binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle fiber, triggering a series of events that
        lead
        to muscle contraction. Acetylcholine is rapidly degraded in the synaptic cleft by the enzyme
        acetylcholinesterase,
        which breaks it down into choline and acetate. The choline is then transported back into the presynaptic neuron
        for reuse in acetylcholine synthesis. Dysfunction in acetylcholine synthesis, release, or degradation can result

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the mechanism of synthesis of acetylcholine, its function, and degradation at the
        neuromuscular junction.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The synthesis of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction begins with the uptake of
        choline
        from the extracellular fluid into the nerve terminal. Once inside, choline is acetylated by the enzyme choline
        acetyltransferase, using acetyl-CoA as a substrate. The resulting acetylcholine is then stored in vesicles
        within
        the nerve terminal until it is released in response to an action potential.
        Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter, binding to nicotinic receptors on the motor endplate of skeletal
        muscle fibers, causing depolarization and subsequent contraction of the muscle. Following release, acetylcholine
        is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes the acetylcholine molecule into choline and
        acetate.
        The choline is then transported back into the nerve terminal for reuse in the synthesis of new acetylcholine.

        membrane. The opening and closing of ion channels is regulated by various factors, such as the membrane
        potential,
        the presence of ligands or neurotransmitters, and mechanical forces. When an ion channel opens, ions flow down
        their electrochemical gradient, either into or out of the cell, depending on the concentration gradient and the
        charge of the ion. This movement of ions can change the membrane potential and trigger various cellular
        processes,

        <br><br>
        <b>Explain the mechanism of action of snake venom:</b>
        Snake venom can act on various targets in the body such as the nervous system, cardiovascular system, and blood
        coagulation system. It can cause paralysis, hypotension, and bleeding disorders in the victim. Some venoms also
        have cytotoxic or hemotoxic effects, causing tissue damage or destruction of red blood cells.
        <br><br>
        <b>Inhibitory function of snake venom:</b>
        Snake venom can also have inhibitory functions. For example, some venoms contain proteins that block the
        transmission of nerve impulses, leading to paralysis of the prey. Other venoms contain anticoagulant proteins
        that
        prevent blood clotting, allowing the snake to more easily consume its prey.

      <h2 class="qa-question">I. Polio virus</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer"><b>1. Write short notes on Polio vaccine.</b><br>
        Polio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis, a viral disease that affects the nervous system. The
        vaccine is available in two forms: oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). OPV contains
        live, weakened strains of the poliovirus, while IPV contains killed poliovirus. Both vaccines are effective in
        preventing polio, but OPV is easier to administer and can also provide herd immunity. The World Health
        Organization recommends the use of both vaccines to achieve global eradication of polio. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">List different types of Polio vaccine. Write merits and demerits of polio vaccine.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        There are two types of polio vaccines:
        <br>- Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): This vaccine contains killed poliovirus and is given as an injection. The
        vaccine produces an immune response in the body without causing the disease. IPV has several merits such as
        providing long-lasting immunity, not causing vaccine-associated paralysis, and being safe for immunocompromised
        individuals. However, it requires multiple doses for full protection and is more expensive than the oral
        vaccine.
        <br>- Oral polio vaccine (OPV): This vaccine contains weakened live poliovirus and is given as drops in the
        mouth.
        The vaccine also produces an immune response without causing the disease. OPV is easy to administer, provides
        immunity to both the vaccinated individual and those who come in contact with the vaccinated individual, and is
        cheaper than the IPV. However, in rare cases, the weakened virus in the vaccine can mutate and cause
        vaccine-associated paralysis. This risk is higher in areas with low vaccination coverage.

      <h2 class="qa-question">Name the clinical material for recovery of polio virus. Describe the method of polio
        immunization.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        The clinical material used for the recovery of poliovirus is stool samples from infected individuals. The virus
        can be isolated and grown in a laboratory using cell cultures.

        Polio immunization can be done using either the IPV or the OPV. The IPV is given as an injection in the arm or
        leg, while the OPV is given as drops in the mouth. Both vaccines produce an immune response without causing the
        disease. The immunization schedule for polio vaccines depends on the type of vaccine being used and the age of
        the
        individual. In general, multiple doses are required for full protection, and booster doses may be needed to
        maintain immunity.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Write a short note on Polio virus.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        Polio virus is a highly infectious virus that mainly affects children under the age of 5. The virus is spread
        through contaminated food and water, and it attacks the nervous system, causing paralysis. The virus has three
        serotypes, and infection with one serotype does not provide immunity to the other serotypes. In severe cases,
        polio can cause permanent paralysis or death.

        The development of polio vaccines has led to a significant reduction in the number of polio cases worldwide.
        However, the virus is still present in a few countries, and vaccination efforts must continue to ensure the
        eradication of polio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe morphology of Polio virus and state how it is transmitted.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Poliovirus is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family
        Picornaviridae. It has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of approximately 30 nanometers. The capsid is made
        up
        of four proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, which are responsible for protecting the viral genome and facilitating
        viral entry into host cells. Poliovirus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, which means that the virus
        is
        present in the feces of infected individuals and can be transmitted to others through contaminated food, water,
        or
        surfaces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Discuss pathogenesis of poliovirus.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth and nose and replicates in the gastrointestinal
        tract. The virus then spreads to the lymphoid tissue, where it can cause a mild infection or enter the
        bloodstream
        and cause viremia. In approximately 1% of cases, the virus can invade the central nervous system, causing
        inflammation and damage to motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This can result in muscle weakness,
        paralysis, and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. The pathogenesis of poliovirus is not completely
        understood,
        but it is thought to involve both direct viral damage to motor neurons and an immune-mediated response to the
        virus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes: Oral polio vaccine</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a live, attenuated vaccine that contains weakened strains of the
        poliovirus. It is administered orally and replicates in the gastrointestinal tract, providing immunity against
        all
        three serotypes of the virus. OPV has been instrumental in the global eradication of polio, as it is easy to
        administer and can be given to large numbers of people in areas with limited access to healthcare. However, in
        rare cases, the live virus in OPV can mutate and cause vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP). For this
        reason,
        some countries have switched to using inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which contains killed virus and cannot
        cause VAPP.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">1. Write short notes on i. Rabies virus ii. Rabies vaccine</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        i. Rabies virus: Rabies is a viral disease caused by the rabies virus, which belongs to the family
        Rhabdoviridae.
        The virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. It infects the central
        nervous system and can cause inflammation of the brain, leading to symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle
        weakness, and convulsions. Rabies is a serious and often fatal disease if not treated promptly.

        ii. Rabies vaccine: The rabies vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rabies. It contains inactivated rabies virus
        that stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. The vaccine is usually given
        in
        a series of injections, either before or after exposure to the virus. Pre-exposure vaccination is recommended
        for
        people who are at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, and travelers to
        countries where rabies is common. Post-exposure vaccination is recommended for people who have been bitten or
        scratched by an animal suspected of being infected with the rabies virus.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">2. Describe the pathogenesis of rabies.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        The pathogenesis of rabies involves the replication of the virus in the peripheral nervous system and its
        subsequent spread to the central nervous system (CNS). After being transmitted through the saliva of an infected
        animal, the virus enters the body through a bite or scratch and travels along the peripheral nerves to the
        spinal
        cord and brain.

        Once in the CNS, the virus replicates rapidly, causing inflammation and damage to the brain and other parts of
        the
        CNS. The virus also travels back along the nerves to the salivary glands, where it can be transmitted to other
        animals through biting.

        The symptoms of rabies usually appear within a few weeks to a few months after exposure, although the incubation
        period can be as short as a few days or as long as several years. The early symptoms of rabies include fever,
        headache, and weakness or discomfort at the site of the bite. As the disease progresses, symptoms such as
        anxiety,
        confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and paralysis may occur. Without prompt treatment, rabies is usually
        fatal.
