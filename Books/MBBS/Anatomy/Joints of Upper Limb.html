            <h2 class="qa-question">Give the anatomical/ embryological basis of shoulder joint dislocation. [2]</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint
                where the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. The joint is surrounded
                by
                a loose capsule and is stabilized by ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Shoulder joint dislocation can
                occur
                due to trauma or injury that causes the humeral head to dislocate from the glenoid fossa.</p>


            <h2 class="qa-question">List the movements that occur at shoulder joint. Name the muscles that bring about
                those movements. [2+3 = 5]</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">
                The movements that occur at the shoulder joint are:<br>
                <strong>1. Flexion and extension</strong> - The muscles responsible for flexion are the anterior fibers
                of
                deltoid, pectoralis major, and coracobrachialis, while the muscles responsible for extension are the
                posterior fibers of deltoid and latissimus dorsi.<br>
                <strong>2. Abduction and adduction</strong> - The muscles responsible for abduction are the middle
                fibers of
                deltoid, supraspinatus, and serratus anterior, while the muscles responsible for adduction are the
                pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major.<br>
                <strong>3. Internal and external rotation</strong> - The muscles responsible for internal rotation are
                the
                subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi, while the muscles responsible for external rotation
                are
                the infraspinatus and teres minor.

                    plexus,
                    lymph nodes, and fat. Winging of the scapula is caused by paralysis or weakness of the serratus
                    anterior
                    muscle, which is innervated by the long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve arises from the
                    brachial
                    plexus and runs along the lateral aspect of the chest wall to supply the serratus anterior muscle.

                        <p class="qa-answer">Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it

                        <h3>a) Capsule and important ligament</h3>
                        <p>The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation between the femur and the
                            acetabulum of the hip bone. The joint is enclosed by a fibrous joint capsule that is
                            reinforced
                            by three strong ligaments: the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments.</p>

                        <p>The movements at the hip joint include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and
                            lateral rotation. The flexion is mainly caused by the iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and
                            sartorius
                            muscles, while the extension is caused by the gluteus maximus and hamstrings. The adduction
                            is
                            caused by the adductor magnus, longus, and brevis muscles, and the abduction is caused by
                            the
                            gluteus medius and minimus muscles. The medial and lateral rotation are mainly caused by the

                            arteries, which are branches of the deep femoral artery. The clinical significance of this
                            blood
                            supply is that the femoral head is at risk of avascular necrosis when there is a disruption

                        <h3>a) Semitendinosus muscle:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The semitendinosus muscle is one of three muscles that make up the hamstrings muscle group.
                            It
                            is a long, thin muscle located at the back of the thigh. The muscle originates from the
                            ischial
                            tuberosity of the pelvis and inserts into the upper part of the tibia bone in the lower leg.

                            The primary function of the semitendinosus muscle is to flex and medially rotate the leg at
                            the
                            knee joint. It also helps to extend the thigh at the hip joint and contributes to the
                            stabilization of the knee joint.

                            The muscle is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. It receives blood supply
                            from the medial circumflex femoral artery and the inferior gluteal artery.

                            The semitendinosus muscle is commonly involved in sports-related injuries, such as strains
                            and
                            tears. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help prevent these injuries and improve
                            overall leg flexibility and strength.</p>

                            of the medial condyle of the femur. The main function of the cruciate ligaments is to

                            the knee joint by preventing excessive anterior or posterior movements of the tibia on the

                            are
                            covered with articular cartilage, which provides smooth gliding movements. The menisci are
                            two
                            fibrocartilaginous structures located between the femur and tibia, which act as shock

                    thin actin filaments. The myosin filaments are located in the center of the sarcomere, while the
                    actin
                    filaments are located on either side of the myosin filaments. The light bands are composed of actin
                    filaments, while the dark bands are composed of myosin filaments. The region where the light and
                    dark
                    bands meet is called the Z-line. The sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized type of endoplasmic
                    reticulum, surrounds the myofibrils and stores calcium ions that are required for muscle
                    contraction.

                    of
                    events. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a motor neuron, it triggers the release of a
                    neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction
                    and
                    binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber. This binding causes a change in the

                    organisms
                    to adjust their behavioral responses to repeated stimuli. Habituation is the process by which an
                    organism becomes less responsive to a stimulus after repeated exposure. This occurs when synaptic
                    connections between sensory neurons and interneurons in the central nervous system become weaker
                    over
                    time. Sensitization, on the other hand, is the process by which an organism becomes more responsive

                <p class="qa-answer">Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other
                    through specialized junctions called synapses. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic
                    terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These
                    neurotransmitters
                    bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and cause a change in the membrane potential, either
                    by
                    depolarization or hyperpolarization. The strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons can
                    be

                <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a specialized junction between two nerve cells, where one neuron (the
                    presynaptic neuron) releases a chemical neurotransmitter that binds to receptors on the postsynaptic
                    neuron, transmitting the signal from one neuron to the next. Synaptic transmission occurs when an
                    action
                    potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, causing the release of
                    neurotransmitter
                    molecules into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic
                    neuron,
                    leading to changes in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron that may generate an action
                    potential.
                    Four properties of a synapse are:

                    Plasticity: the ability to change and adapt in response to changes in neuronal activity or
                    experience.
                    Spatial summation: the integration of signals from multiple presynaptic neurons at a single

                    neuron.
                    Temporal summation: the integration of signals from a single presynaptic neuron over time.

                <p class="qa-answer">The steps of muscular transmission are as follows:
                    1. An action potential arrives at the axon terminal of a motor neuron.
                    2. Acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft.
                    3. ACh binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.
                    4. This generates an action potential in the muscle fiber.
                    5. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber, leading to muscle contraction.
                    Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue,
                    particularly
                    in the muscles of the eyes, face, throat, and limbs. It is caused by the production of
                    autoantibodies
                    that target and destroy the ACh receptors on the motor end plate of muscle fibers, leading to a

                    the
                    muscle fibers. The symptoms of myasthenia gravis can be managed with medications that enhance the

                <p class="qa-answer">Skeletal muscle contraction occurs when myosin and actin filaments slide over each
                    other. This sliding is driven by the interaction between myosin heads and actin binding sites. The
                    process is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the
                    sarcoplasm,
                    which binds to troponin and causes a conformational change that exposes the actin binding sites.
                    This
                    allows myosin heads to bind to the actin and undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments
                    towards
                    the center of the sarcomere.
                    Motor unit refers to a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor
                    neuron
                    fires, all the muscle fibers it innervates contract simultaneously. Rigor mortis is the stiffening
                    of
                    muscles that occurs after death due to the depletion of ATP, which is necessary for muscle
                    relaxation.

                    coupling, contraction, and relaxation. During excitation, an action potential propagates along the

                    reticulum. During excitation-contraction coupling, calcium ions bind to troponin, leading to the
                    exposure of actin binding sites and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycle. During contraction,
                    myosin
                    heads bind to actin, undergo a power stroke, and slide the actin filaments towards the center of the

                    The action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the

                    Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges.
                    ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, causing the myosin head to change conformation and pull the actin

                    of the sarcomere, shortening the muscle fiber and generating force. During relaxation, the calcium

                <p class="qa-answer">Calcium ions play a crucial role in the process of excitation-contraction coupling,
                    which is the process by which an action potential triggers muscle contraction. When an action
                    potential
                    travels down a motor neuron and reaches the neuromuscular junction, it causes the release of the
                    neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, causing
                    depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the
                    sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to a release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm of the muscle
                    fiber.
                    The calcium ions then bind to the protein complex troponin, which is part of the thin filament of
                    the
                    sarcomere. This binding causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex, which
                    exposes the binding sites on the actin filament. This allows myosin heads to bind to actin, forming
                    cross-bridges and initiating muscle contraction. In summary, calcium ions play a crucial role in the
                    initiation and regulation of muscle contraction through their binding to troponin and subsequent
                    exposure of actin binding sites.</p>

                    the

            <p class="qa-answer">Clonus is a rhythmic involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in response to
                sustained
                muscle stretch. It is caused by a hyperactive stretch reflex due to damage or dysfunction of the central
                nervous system. Tetanic muscle contraction is a sustained and maximal contraction of muscle fibers in
                response to high-frequency stimulation. It occurs due to the accumulation of intracellular calcium ions,
                which promote the binding of myosin and actin filaments and prolong the duration of contraction.</p>
            <h3 class="qa-subquestion">b) Oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers.</h3>
            <p class="qa-answer">Oxidative muscle fibers are slow-twitch fibers that rely primarily on aerobic
                metabolism to
                generate ATP. They contain large numbers of mitochondria, myoglobin, and oxidative enzymes, which allow
                them
                to sustain prolonged contractions without fatigue. Glycolytic muscle fibers are fast-twitch fibers that
                rely
                primarily on anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP. They contain fewer mitochondria, myoglobin, and
                oxidative
                enzymes, but have a higher concentration of glycolytic enzymes and can generate high levels of force
                rapidly. Skeletal muscles contain both types of fibers, but the proportion varies depending on the

            <h2 class="qa-question">Describe in detail the structure and function of the muscle spindle.</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">A muscle spindle is a sensory receptor located within the muscle that is responsible
                for
                detecting changes in muscle length and rate of change in length. It consists of several intrafusal
                muscle
                fibers surrounded by a capsule, which is innervated by sensory nerve fibers. The intrafusal muscle
                fibers
                are of two types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers.
                The muscle spindle functions to provide sensory feedback to the central nervous system regarding muscle
                length and rate of change in length. When the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal muscle fibers within
                the
                spindle are also stretched, which activates the sensory nerve fibers within the capsule. These sensory
                fibers then send signals to the spinal cord and brain, providing information about the length and rate
                of
                change of the muscle.

                The muscle spindle also plays a critical role in maintaining muscle tone by detecting changes in muscle
                length and initiating reflexive muscle contractions to resist changes in length.</p>

                central
                nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord receive sensory
                information from muscle spindles and other sensory receptors and integrate this information with other
                motor
                commands to modulate muscle tone.
                The brain can exert its influence on muscle tone through descending pathways that originate from the
                motor
                cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These pathways regulate the excitability of spinal motor neurons,
                which in turn affects muscle tone. For example, the corticospinal tract from the motor cortex can
                influence
                the activity of spinal motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles, thereby modulating muscle tone.

                The supraspinal control of muscle tone is also influenced by other factors such as emotional state,
                stress,
                and fatigue. For example, stress can lead to increased muscle tension and elevated muscle tone, while

                acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. It produces a sustained depolarization of the
                muscle fiber, which results in muscle relaxation. The depolarization also prevents muscle contraction,
                which is necessary for intubation and surgery. Succinylcholine has a rapid onset and short duration of
                action, making it useful in emergency situations and for brief surgical procedures.</p>

            <p class="qa-answer">Neostigmine and physostigmine are both acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase
                the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which improves muscle strength in
                myasthenia gravis. However, neostigmine is preferred over physostigmine because it has a shorter
                duration of action and fewer side effects. Neostigmine is hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase, while
                physostigmine is metabolized by hepatic enzymes, which leads to a longer duration of action and
                increased risk of side effects such as bradycardia, bronchospasm, and seizures. Neostigmine is also
                preferred for the treatment of myasthenic crisis due to its rapid onset and short duration of action.

                by injection and is often used in combination with other DMARDs. Some common adverse effects of
                methotrexate include nausea, fatigue, and hair loss.</p>

            <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the use of dapsone in leprosy treatment</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">Dapsone is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of leprosy. It works by
                inhibiting the growth and reproduction of the bacteria that cause leprosy. Dapsone is particularly
                effective against the bacteria that cause the milder form of leprosy, known as tuberculoid leprosy.
                However, it is less effective against the bacteria that cause the more severe form of leprosy, known as
                lepromatous leprosy. Dapsone is usually given in combination with other antibiotics, such as rifampicin
                and clofazimine, to ensure a more effective treatment.</p>

            <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on management of multi bacillary leprosy</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">Multi bacillary leprosy is a more severe form of leprosy that requires more aggressive
                treatment. The management of multi bacillary leprosy typically involves a multi-drug therapy (MDT)
                regimen that includes three antibiotics: rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. This MDT regimen is
                usually given for a period of 12 months. In addition to medication, supportive care and monitoring of
                complications are also important. Patients with multi bacillary leprosy should be monitored closely for
                the development of nerve damage, skin ulcers, and other complications. Rehabilitation services, such as
                physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and social support, may also be required to help patients manage
                the physical and social effects of leprosy.</p>

            <h2 class="qa-question">Write down the multi drug therapy regimen for the treatment of leprosy. Write down
                in brief about dapsone</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">The multi-drug therapy (MDT) regimen for the treatment of leprosy typically includes a
                combination of antibiotics such as rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. The exact duration and
                combination of antibiotics used in MDT may vary depending on the severity and type of leprosy. However,
                a standard regimen for multi bacillary leprosy involves daily doses of rifampicin and clofazimine for 12
                months, along with monthly doses of dapsone. Dapsone is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting the
                growth and reproduction of the bacteria that cause leprosy. It is particularly effective against the
                bacteria that cause the milder form of leprosy, known as tuberculoid leprosy. However, it is less
                effective against the bacteria that cause the more severe form of leprosy, known as lepromatous leprosy.

            <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on treatment of leprosy.</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium
                leprae. The treatment of leprosy involves a combination of antibiotics, typically a multi-drug therapy
                (MDT), that targets the bacteria responsible for the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)
                recommends a combination of rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone for the treatment of leprosy. The
                duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of leprosy, but typically lasts for six months to
                one year. Treatment can also involve surgery to correct deformities caused by the disease, as well as
                physical therapy and rehabilitation to restore function to affected areas of the body. Early diagnosis
                and treatment can help prevent the development of complications and the spread of the disease to others.
