    <h2 class="qa-question">What is Duchenne syndrome? How can you correlate with calcium level? Give possible molecular explanation.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. The disease is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which leads to the absence of the dystrophin protein in muscle cells. Dystrophin plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers. 
    Correlation with calcium level can be explained by the fact that the absence of dystrophin disrupts the normal calcium signaling in muscle cells, leading to calcium overload and muscle damage. 
    A possible molecular explanation is that the absence of dystrophin leads to increased permeability of the sarcolemma, which allows excessive entry of calcium ions into the cell, leading to oxidative stress and activation of proteolytic enzymes that degrade the muscle fibers. A diagram showing the molecular mechanism of DMD can be included for further explanation.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the biochemical and genetic basis of muscular dystrophy.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited muscle diseases that affect muscle function and weaken muscle strength over time. The genetic basis of muscular dystrophy is related to mutations in genes responsible for producing proteins involved in muscle structure and function. In particular, mutations in the dystrophin gene have been linked to the most common form of muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The absence or abnormality of dystrophin protein causes muscle cells to become fragile and easily damaged, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting.
Biochemical abnormalities associated with muscular dystrophy include increased levels of creatine kinase, a protein released into the bloodstream when muscle cells break down. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. </p>

<h2 class="qa-question">Mention two causes of hypocalcemia with biochemical basis.</h2>
<p class="qa-answer">Hypocalcemia is a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood. Causes of hypocalcemia can include deficiencies in dietary calcium intake, vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and renal failure. Two causes of hypocalcemia with biochemical basis include vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D is necessary for the absorption of calcium from the diet, and deficiency can lead to hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism is a condition characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone, which is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood. Inadequate levels of parathyroid hormone can result in low levels of calcium in the blood.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the distribution of calcium and phosphate in our body. Explain the biosynthesis of calcitriol and its role in homeostasis of Calcium and Phosphate. [2067]</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Calcium and phosphate are two important minerals found in the human body. Approximately 99% of the body's calcium is stored in bones and teeth, while the remaining 1% is found in the blood and soft tissues. In contrast, about 85% of the body's phosphate is found in bones and teeth, while the remaining 15% is distributed in the blood and soft tissues.
  Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D, which is synthesized in the kidneys. The synthesis of calcitriol is stimulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low levels of calcium in the blood. Calcitriol increases the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine and reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the kidney. It also stimulates the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, thereby increasing their levels in the blood. This helps to maintain the homeostasis of calcium and phosphate in the body.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">List and explain diseases associated with hypercalcemia. [2065]</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Hypercalcemia is a condition in which there is an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including overproduction of parathyroid hormone, certain types of cancer, and excessive intake of calcium or vitamin D supplements. Some of the diseases associated with hypercalcemia include:
  Hyperparathyroidism: This is a condition in which the parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone, leading to increased levels of calcium in the blood.
  Cancer: Certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma and some types of lung cancer, can cause hypercalcemia by producing factors that increase calcium levels in the blood.
  Vitamin D toxicity: Excessive intake of vitamin D supplements can lead to hypercalcemia, as vitamin D stimulates the absorption of calcium from the intestine.
  Paget's disease: This is a condition in which there is abnormal bone remodeling, leading to increased release of calcium into the blood.
  Hyperthyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, leading to increased bone turnover and release of calcium into the blood.
  The symptoms of hypercalcemia can include fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, kidney stones, and altered mental status. Treatment of hypercalcemia depends on the underlying cause and may include medications, hydration, and sometimes surgery.</p>

    <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of calcium in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction. [2063]</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Calcium plays a crucial role in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction. When an action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine is released, leading to the depolarization of the muscle fiber. This depolarization causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium then binds to the troponin on the actin filaments, leading to a conformational change in the tropomyosin that exposes the myosin-binding site on the actin. Myosin then binds to actin, forming a cross-bridge, which leads to muscle contraction. When the action potential ceases, calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to relaxation of the muscle fiber.</p>

PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands and increases plasma calcium levels by stimulating osteoclast activity, which breaks down bone and releases calcium into the bloodstream. PTH also increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and decreases calcium excretion. Calcitonin is produced by the thyroid gland and lowers plasma calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting calcium deposition in bone. Vitamin D, which is produced in the skin and converted to its active form in the liver and kidneys, increases plasma calcium levels by promoting calcium absorption in the intestines and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.</p>

    <p class="qa-answer">Thiazide diuretics are known to cause an increase in calcium levels in the blood, leading to hypercalcemia. This is due to their effect on the distal tubules of the kidneys, where they inhibit the reabsorption of calcium. As a result, more calcium remains in the urine and less is excreted, causing an increase in the concentration of calcium in the blood.</p>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of hormone in calcium regulation.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Hormones play a crucial role in the regulation of calcium levels in the body. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin are two hormones that are involved in this process. PTH is released by the parathyroid glands in response to low calcium levels in the blood. It stimulates the release of calcium from the bones and increases the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. On the other hand, calcitonin is released by the thyroid gland in response to high calcium levels in the blood. It inhibits the release of calcium from the bones and promotes its excretion by the kidneys.</p>

    <p class="qa-answer">Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine and their deposition in bones. In the kidneys, vitamin D is converted to its active form, Calcitriol. Calcitriol promotes the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the urine, thereby increasing their serum levels. Calcitriol also promotes bone resorption to maintain serum calcium levels. Therefore, vitamin D and Calcitriol play a crucial role in maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis.</p>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of PTH and calcitriol in hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia.</h2>
    <p class="qa-answer">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol play important roles in the regulation of serum calcium levels. In hypocalcemia, PTH is released from the parathyroid gland, which stimulates the release of calcium from bones, increases the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium from the kidneys, and activates vitamin D in the kidneys to increase the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine. This results in an increase in serum calcium levels. On the other hand, in hypercalcemia, the secretion of PTH is inhibited, and the secretion of calcitonin is stimulated. Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption, increases the excretion of calcium and phosphate in urine, and decreases the absorption of calcium from the intestine, resulting in a decrease in serum calcium levels.</p>

  Three causes of hypocalcemia are:
  
  Hypoparathyroidism, which is the deficiency of PTH secretion. PTH stimulates calcium release from bones, calcium reabsorption from the kidneys, and vitamin D activation in the kidneys. The deficiency of PTH results in decreased serum calcium levels.
  Vitamin D deficiency, which impairs calcium absorption from the intestine and leads to decreased serum calcium levels.

The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome further perpetuates the inflammatory response, leading to the characteristic acute attacks of gout. The morphology of gout is characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in the joint space, leading to the formation of tophi and erosions in the joint cartilage and bone. The crystals are often seen under polarized light as needle-shaped and negatively birefringent. The acute attacks of gout are characterized by intense pain, swelling, and redness in the affected joint. The attacks often occur at night and can last for several days. Over time, chronic deposition of urate crystals in the joints can lead to joint damage and chronic arthritis. In advanced stages of the disease, tophi can develop, which are firm, chalky deposits of urate crystals that can be seen under the skin or in joints. Gout can also cause the development of renal stones due to the deposition of urate crystals in the kidneys. Treatment of gout involves the management of acute attacks with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine and the prevention of future attacks through lifestyle modifications and medications that lower serum urate levels, such as allopurinol or febuxostat.</p>

            <h2 class="qa-question">Give the anatomical/ embryological basis of shoulder joint dislocation. [2]</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint
                where the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. The joint is surrounded
                by
                a loose capsule and is stabilized by ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Shoulder joint dislocation can
                occur
                due to trauma or injury that causes the humeral head to dislocate from the glenoid fossa.</p>


            <h2 class="qa-question">List the movements that occur at shoulder joint. Name the muscles that bring about
                those movements. [2+3 = 5]</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">
                The movements that occur at the shoulder joint are:<br>
                <strong>1. Flexion and extension</strong> - The muscles responsible for flexion are the anterior fibers
                of
                deltoid, pectoralis major, and coracobrachialis, while the muscles responsible for extension are the
                posterior fibers of deltoid and latissimus dorsi.<br>
                <strong>2. Abduction and adduction</strong> - The muscles responsible for abduction are the middle
                fibers of
                deltoid, supraspinatus, and serratus anterior, while the muscles responsible for adduction are the
                pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major.<br>
                <strong>3. Internal and external rotation</strong> - The muscles responsible for internal rotation are
                the
                subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi, while the muscles responsible for external rotation
                are
                the infraspinatus and teres minor.

                        <h3>a) Semitendinosus muscle:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The semitendinosus muscle is one of three muscles that make up the hamstrings muscle group.
                            It
                            is a long, thin muscle located at the back of the thigh. The muscle originates from the
                            ischial
                            tuberosity of the pelvis and inserts into the upper part of the tibia bone in the lower leg.

                            The primary function of the semitendinosus muscle is to flex and medially rotate the leg at
                            the
                            knee joint. It also helps to extend the thigh at the hip joint and contributes to the
                            stabilization of the knee joint.

                            The muscle is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. It receives blood supply
                            from the medial circumflex femoral artery and the inferior gluteal artery.

                            The semitendinosus muscle is commonly involved in sports-related injuries, such as strains
                            and
                            tears. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help prevent these injuries and improve
                            overall leg flexibility and strength.</p>

                            ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The ACL is attached to the anterior
                            intercondylar area of the tibia and the posterior part of the lateral condyle of the femur,
                            while the PCL is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and the anterior

                            of the medial condyle of the femur. The main function of the cruciate ligaments is to
                            stabilize
                            the knee joint by preventing excessive anterior or posterior movements of the tibia on the

                <p class="qa-answer">Foot drop is a condition where the foot is unable to dorsiflex due to damage to the
                    common fibular nerve. The common fibular nerve is derived from the posterior division of the sacral
                    plexus, which originates from the spinal cord segments L4-S3. The nerve passes through the popliteal
                    fossa and wraps around the fibular neck before dividing into the superficial and deep fibular
                    nerves.
                    Damage to this nerve can result from various causes such as trauma, compression, or injury, leading
                    to

                    units
                    called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere contains two types of protein filaments: thick myosin filaments
                    and
                    thin actin filaments. The myosin filaments are located in the center of the sarcomere, while the
                    actin
                    filaments are located on either side of the myosin filaments. The light bands are composed of actin

                <p class="qa-answer">The transmission of an impulse across the neuromuscular junction involves a series
                    of
                    events. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a motor neuron, it triggers the release of a
                    neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction
                    and
                    binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber. This binding causes a change in the
                    permeability of the muscle fiber membrane, which results in the influx of sodium ions and the
                    generation
                    of an action potential. The action potential spreads along the muscle fiber membrane and triggers
                    the
                    release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which initiates muscle contraction.</p>

                <p class="qa-answer">Habituation and sensitization are two types of synaptic plasticity that allow
                    organisms
                    to adjust their behavioral responses to repeated stimuli. Habituation is the process by which an
                    organism becomes less responsive to a stimulus after repeated exposure. This occurs when synaptic
                    connections between sensory neurons and interneurons in the central nervous system become weaker
                    over
                    time. Sensitization, on the other hand, is the process by which an organism becomes more responsive
                    to a
                    stimulus after repeated exposure. This occurs when synaptic connections between sensory neurons and
                    interneurons become stronger over time. Both habituation and sensitization are important adaptive
                    mechanisms that allow organisms to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli.</p>

                <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on: Synaptic transmission.</h2>
                <p class="qa-answer">Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other
                    through specialized junctions called synapses. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic
                    terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These
                    neurotransmitters
                    bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and cause a change in the membrane potential, either
                    by
                    depolarization or hyperpolarization. The strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons can
                    be
                    modified by a variety of factors, including changes in the number or sensitivity of receptors, as
                    well
                    as changes in the amount or release of neurotransmitters. Synaptic transmission is a highly dynamic
                    process that underlies many important functions of the nervous system, including learning and
                    memory.

                <p class="qa-answer">Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular
                    junction.
                    The physiological basis of myasthenia gravis is the production of autoantibodies against the
                    acetylcholine receptors located on the muscle endplate. These antibodies block or destroy the
                    receptors,

                <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a specialized junction between two nerve cells, where one neuron (the
                    presynaptic neuron) releases a chemical neurotransmitter that binds to receptors on the postsynaptic
                    neuron, transmitting the signal from one neuron to the next. Synaptic transmission occurs when an
                    action
                    potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, causing the release of
                    neurotransmitter
                    molecules into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic
                    neuron,
                    leading to changes in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron that may generate an action
                    potential.
                    Four properties of a synapse are:

                    Plasticity: the ability to change and adapt in response to changes in neuronal activity or
                    experience.
                    Spatial summation: the integration of signals from multiple presynaptic neurons at a single
                    postsynaptic
                    neuron.
                    Temporal summation: the integration of signals from a single presynaptic neuron over time.
                    Synaptic efficacy: the strength of the connection between two neurons and the ability of the synapse

                <p class="qa-answer">The steps of muscular transmission are as follows:
                    1. An action potential arrives at the axon terminal of a motor neuron.
                    2. Acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft.
                    3. ACh binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.
                    4. This generates an action potential in the muscle fiber.
                    5. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber, leading to muscle contraction.
                    Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue,
                    particularly
                    in the muscles of the eyes, face, throat, and limbs. It is caused by the production of
                    autoantibodies
                    that target and destroy the ACh receptors on the motor end plate of muscle fibers, leading to a
                    reduction in the number of functional receptors and impairing the transmission of nerve impulses to
                    the
                    muscle fibers. The symptoms of myasthenia gravis can be managed with medications that enhance the

                <p class="qa-answer">Skeletal muscle contraction occurs when myosin and actin filaments slide over each
                    other. This sliding is driven by the interaction between myosin heads and actin binding sites. The
                    process is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the
                    sarcoplasm,
                    which binds to troponin and causes a conformational change that exposes the actin binding sites.
                    This

                    reticulum. During excitation-contraction coupling, calcium ions bind to troponin, leading to the
                    exposure of actin binding sites and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycle. During contraction,
                    myosin
                    heads bind to actin, undergo a power stroke, and slide the actin filaments towards the center of the

                    This causes the sarcolemma to depolarize, generating an action potential that spreads along the

                    potential
                    travels down a motor neuron and reaches the neuromuscular junction, it causes the release of the
                    neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, causing
                    depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the
                    sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to a release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm of the muscle
                    fiber.
                    The calcium ions then bind to the protein complex troponin, which is part of the thin filament of
                    the
                    sarcomere. This binding causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex, which

                <p class="qa-answer">The sliding filament theory of skeletal muscle contraction proposes that during
                    muscle
                    contraction, the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, resulting in the shortening of
                    the
                    muscle fiber. The binding of calcium ions to troponin triggers a conformational change that moves
                    tropomyosin, exposing the active binding sites on actin. The myosin head then binds to the exposed
                    binding sites on actin and undergoes a power stroke, pulling the actin filament towards the center
                    of
                    the sarcomere. This cycle continues as long as calcium ions are present and ATP is available. In
                    isotonic contraction, the muscle shortens while producing force, allowing movement to occur. </p>

                <p class="qa-answer">A beneficial effect is a desirable or positive outcome of a particular action or
                    intervention. Isotonic and isometric muscle contractions differ in terms of the type of muscle
                    contraction produced. Isometric contraction occurs when the muscle produces force without changing
                    its
                    length, whereas isotonic contraction occurs when the muscle changes its length while producing
                    force.

                    The

                in
                muscle length and muscle tension. They are made up of specialized muscle fibers called intrafusal
                fibers,

                which
                provides resistance to passive movements. It is maintained by the tonic activity of motor neurons in the

            <h3 class="qa-subquestion">a) Physiological basis of clonus and tetanic muscle contraction.</h3>
            <p class="qa-answer">Clonus is a rhythmic involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in response to
                sustained
                muscle stretch. It is caused by a hyperactive stretch reflex due to damage or dysfunction of the central
                nervous system. Tetanic muscle contraction is a sustained and maximal contraction of muscle fibers in
                response to high-frequency stimulation. It occurs due to the accumulation of intracellular calcium ions,
                which promote the binding of myosin and actin filaments and prolong the duration of contraction.</p>
            <h3 class="qa-subquestion">b) Oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers.</h3>
            <p class="qa-answer">Oxidative muscle fibers are slow-twitch fibers that rely primarily on aerobic
                metabolism to
                generate ATP. They contain large numbers of mitochondria, myoglobin, and oxidative enzymes, which allow
                them
                to sustain prolonged contractions without fatigue. Glycolytic muscle fibers are fast-twitch fibers that
                rely
                primarily on anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP. They contain fewer mitochondria, myoglobin, and
                oxidative
                enzymes, but have a higher concentration of glycolytic enzymes and can generate high levels of force
                rapidly. Skeletal muscles contain both types of fibers, but the proportion varies depending on the

            <h2 class="qa-question">Describe in detail the structure and function of the muscle spindle.</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">A muscle spindle is a sensory receptor located within the muscle that is responsible
                for
                detecting changes in muscle length and rate of change in length. It consists of several intrafusal
                muscle
                fibers surrounded by a capsule, which is innervated by sensory nerve fibers. The intrafusal muscle
                fibers
                are of two types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers.
                The muscle spindle functions to provide sensory feedback to the central nervous system regarding muscle
                length and rate of change in length. When the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal muscle fibers within
                the
                spindle are also stretched, which activates the sensory nerve fibers within the capsule. These sensory
                fibers then send signals to the spinal cord and brain, providing information about the length and rate
                of
                change of the muscle.

                The muscle spindle also plays a critical role in maintaining muscle tone by detecting changes in muscle
                length and initiating reflexive muscle contractions to resist changes in length.</p>

            <p class="qa-answer">Supraspinal control of muscle tone refers to the regulation of muscle tone by the
                central
                nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord receive sensory
                information from muscle spindles and other sensory receptors and integrate this information with other
                motor
                commands to modulate muscle tone.
                The brain can exert its influence on muscle tone through descending pathways that originate from the
                motor
                cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These pathways regulate the excitability of spinal motor neurons,
                which in turn affects muscle tone. For example, the corticospinal tract from the motor cortex can
                influence
                the activity of spinal motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles, thereby modulating muscle tone.

                The supraspinal control of muscle tone is also influenced by other factors such as emotional state,
                stress,
                and fatigue. For example, stress can lead to increased muscle tension and elevated muscle tone, while

                blockers?</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">Depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, such as suxamethonium, cause a depolarizing
                blockade at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in temporary paralysis of the muscles.
                Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, such as d-tubocurarine, block the action of acetylcholine at
                the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle relaxation. The onset of action is faster in
                depolarizing blockers and slower in non-depolarizing blockers. Depolarizing blockers have a short
                duration of action, while non-depolarizing blockers have a longer duration of action. Depolarizing
                blockers are associated with side effects such as muscle pain, hyperkalemia, and malignant hyperthermia,
                while non-depolarizing blockers can cause hypotension, bronchospasm, and histamine release. </p>

            <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on neuromuscular blocking agents. [2]</h2>
            <p class="qa-answer">Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are drugs used during surgical procedures to
                produce paralysis of skeletal muscles. They act by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses at the
                neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing muscle contraction. NMBAs are classified as either
                depolarizing or non-depolarizing based on their mechanism of action. Depolarizing agents, such as
                succinylcholine, produce a sustained depolarization of the muscle membrane, leading to muscle paralysis.
                Non-depolarizing agents, such as vecuronium and rocuronium, competitively block the nicotinic
                acetylcholine receptor, leading to muscle paralysis. These drugs are administered intravenously and
                require close monitoring to ensure that the desired level of muscle relaxation is achieved without
                compromising respiratory function or other vital signs.</p>

            <p class="qa-answer">Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are used in a variety of clinical settings,
                including surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and diagnostic testing. In surgical procedures,
                NMBAs are used to achieve muscle relaxation, improve surgical access, and prevent unwanted movement
                during delicate procedures. In mechanical ventilation, NMBAs can be used to facilitate ventilation in
                patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or other conditions that require deep sedation. In
                diagnostic testing, NMBAs can be used to immobilize the patient and prevent muscle movement during
                procedures such as electroconvulsive therapy or bronchoscopy. The use of NMBAs requires careful
                consideration of the risks and benefits, as well as close monitoring of the patient's respiratory and

            <p class="qa-answer">Succinylcholine is a medication that is used as a muscle relaxant. It works by binding
                to the acetylcholine receptors on the motor end plate of the neuromuscular junction, which causes
                depolarization and leads to muscle relaxation. It is commonly used during surgeries and procedures that
                require muscle relaxation. However, it has a short duration of action and can cause side effects such as

            <p class="qa-answer">NSAIDs work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are
                involved in the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins play a role in inflammation, pain, and
                fever. By inhibiting COX enzymes, NSAIDs reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and lower fever. Therapeutic
                uses of NSAIDs include the treatment of pain, inflammation, and fever.
                Selective COX-2 inhibitors have an advantage over non-selective COX inhibitors in that they have a lower
                risk of causing gastrointestinal side effects such as ulcers and bleeding. This is because COX-2
                inhibitors specifically target the COX-2 enzyme, which is involved in inflammation, without affecting
                the COX-1 enzyme, which is involved in the production of protective prostaglandins in the stomach and
                intestines. However, selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as

            <p class="qa-answer">Drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis can be classified into several categories,
                including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
                and biologic agents. Methotrexate is a type of DMARD that works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme
                called dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the production of DNA and cell division. By
                inhibiting this enzyme, methotrexate reduces the proliferation of immune cells and the production of
                inflammatory cytokines, which helps to decrease inflammation and slow the progression of joint damage in
                rheumatoid arthritis.
                Some common adverse effects of methotrexate include nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, hair loss, and liver

                reducing inflammation in the body and is classified as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
                It is believed to work by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are proteins that
                contribute to the inflammation and damage seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Some common adverse effects of

                regimen that includes three antibiotics: rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. This MDT regimen is
                usually given for a period of 12 months. In addition to medication, supportive care and monitoring of
                complications are also important. Patients with multi bacillary leprosy should be monitored closely for
                the development of nerve damage, skin ulcers, and other complications. Rehabilitation services, such as

            <p class="qa-answer">Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium
                leprae. The treatment of leprosy involves a combination of antibiotics, typically a multi-drug therapy
                (MDT), that targets the bacteria responsible for the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)
                recommends a combination of rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone for the treatment of leprosy. The
                duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of leprosy, but typically lasts for six months to
                one year. Treatment can also involve surgery to correct deformities caused by the disease, as well as
                physical therapy and rehabilitation to restore function to affected areas of the body. Early diagnosis
                and treatment can help prevent the development of complications and the spread of the disease to others.
