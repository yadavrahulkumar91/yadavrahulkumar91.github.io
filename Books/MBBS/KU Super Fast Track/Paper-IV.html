      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on Down syndrome?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all
        or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes developmental delays and
        intellectual disabilities. Individuals with Down syndrome may also have physical characteristics such as a small
        stature, upward slanting eyes, and a single crease across the center of the palm. The severity of Down syndrome
        varies widely among individuals, but most people with Down syndrome can lead fulfilling lives with proper
        medical care and educational support.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">How does trisomy occur? Explain the clinical features of trisomy 21.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21
        in every cell of the body. This extra genetic material causes developmental delays, intellectual disabilities,
        and physical characteristics such as a small stature, upward slanting eyes, and a single crease across the
        center of the palm. Trisomy 21 is caused by a random error during cell division in the early stages of fetal
        development, and is not usually inherited from parents. However, the risk of having a child with trisomy 21
        increases with maternal age. Prenatal testing is available to detect trisomy 21 during pregnancy.</p>

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">a) Klinefelter's syndrome</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when a male is born with an extra X
        chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the typical 46. This can lead to developmental
        delays, learning difficulties, and infertility. Physical characteristics may include tall stature, small testes,
        and enlarged breast tissue.</p>
      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">b) How does trisomy occur? Explain the clinical features of trisomy 21.</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Refer to the answer for question 2.</p>
      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">c) Autosomal dominant and recessive disorders</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Autosomal dominant disorders are caused by a single copy of a mutated gene on one of the 22
        pairs of non-sex chromosomes. The mutation is passed down from a parent with the disorder to their child with a
        50% chance of inheritance. Examples of autosomal dominant disorders include Huntington's disease and Marfan
        syndrome. Autosomal recessive disorders occur when a person inherits two copies of a mutated gene, one from each
        parent. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia.</p>

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">(a) Development of long bone.</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Long bones develop from cartilage through the process of endochondral ossification. During
        embryonic development, the cartilage model of the bone is formed and gradually replaced by bone tissue. The
        epiphyseal growth plates at the ends of the long bones are responsible for the longitudinal growth of the bone
        during childhood and adolescence. Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone through nutrient foramina and provide
        nutrition to the bone tissue.</p>

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">(a) Intramembraneous ossification</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Intramembranous ossification is the process by which bone tissue is formed directly from
        mesenchymal connective tissue. This process occurs during the development of flat bones, such as those in the
        skull, and involves the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, which secrete bone matrix and
        initiate calcification. The resulting bone tissue is arranged in layers called lamellae, and blood vessels and
        nerves penetrate the bone tissue through canaliculi.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the histology of compact bone with a suitable diagram.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Compact bone, also known as cortical bone, is a dense and hard type of bone tissue that forms
        the outer layer of bones. It is composed of osteons, which are cylindrical structures made up of concentric
        layers of bone tissue called lamellae. Each osteon contains a central canal, known as the Haversian canal, which
        contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The canaliculi, which are small channels, connect the Haversian
        canals and allow for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the osteocytes. The diagram below
        illustrates the histological features of compact bone.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on: Development of long bone.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Long bones develop from cartilage models during fetal development through a process called
        endochondral ossification. This involves the gradual replacement of the cartilage model by bone tissue. The
        process begins with the formation of a cartilage model, which is gradually replaced by bone tissue beginning at
        the primary center of ossification in the diaphysis, or shaft, of the bone. Secondary centers of ossification
        form in the epiphyses, or ends, of the bone. The growth of long bones occurs at the epiphyseal plate, a layer of
        hyaline cartilage at the junction of the diaphysis and epiphysis, which is gradually replaced by bone tissue
        during development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short note on: Intramembranous ossification.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Intramembranous ossification is the process by which bone tissue forms directly within
        mesenchymal tissue, without a cartilage intermediate. This process occurs primarily in the flat bones of the
        skull, as well as in the clavicles and some facial bones. It involves the differentiation of mesenchymal cells
        into osteoblasts, which deposit mineralized bone matrix around themselves to form bone tissue. As the bone
        tissue grows, blood vessels invade the area, bringing with them osteoclasts, which resorb bone tissue to shape
        the bone and create marrow spaces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the histology of compact bone with a suitable diagram.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Compact bone tissue, also known as cortical bone, is a dense and strong type of bone tissue
        that forms the outer layer of most bones. It is composed of numerous cylindrical units called osteons, or
        Haversian systems, which run parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of concentric lamellae,
        or layers, of mineralized bone matrix surrounding a central Haversian canal that contains blood vessels and
        nerves. Between the lamellae are small spaces called lacunae, which house mature bone cells called osteocytes.
        Canaliculi, or small channels, connect the lacunae and allow osteocytes to communicate with each other and with
        the central Haversian canal. The diagram below illustrates the basic structure of an osteon within compact bone
        tissue.

        and antagonistic group of muscle.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Muscles can be classified into three types based on their structure and function: skeletal,
        smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are responsible for body movements. Examples
        include biceps, triceps, and quadriceps. Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs and control
        involuntary movements. Examples include the muscles in the digestive tract and blood vessels. Cardiac muscles
        are found in the heart and are responsible for pumping blood. Synergistic muscles work together to produce a
        movement, while antagonistic muscles work against each other to produce a movement.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the microscopic anatomy of bone.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The microscopic anatomy of bone consists of two main types of tissue: compact bone and
        cancellous bone. Compact bone is the dense outer layer of bone that gives bones their strength and protection.
        Cancellous bone, also known as spongy bone, is the inner layer of bone that contains small, interconnected
        spaces filled with bone marrow. Within compact bone, there are microscopic units called osteons that consist of
        concentric rings of bone tissue called lamellae, which surround a central canal that contains blood vessels and
        nerves. Between the osteons are small spaces called lacunae that house bone cells called osteocytes, which are
        connected to each other by tiny channels called canaliculi. These structures work together to maintain the
        strength and vitality of the bone.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">What is fertilization? Write short notes on result of fertilization.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Fertilization is the process by which a sperm cell from a male fuses with an egg cell from a
        female to form a zygote, which is the first cell of a new organism. During fertilization, the genetic material
        from the sperm and the egg combine to create a unique genetic makeup for the zygote. This genetic information
        determines the physical and biological characteristics of the organism that develops from the zygote. The result
        of fertilization is the formation of a zygote that undergoes cell division and eventually develops into an
        embryo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe briefly on formation of blastocyst.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The blastocyst is a structure that forms during the early stages of embryonic development,
        typically around five to six days after fertilization. It is formed when the zygote undergoes multiple rounds of
        cell division to form a hollow ball of cells with an inner cell mass and an outer layer of cells called the
        trophoblast. The inner cell mass will eventually develop into the embryo, while the trophoblast will form the
        placenta and other supportive structures. The blastocyst is an important stage in embryonic development because
        it is the stage at which the embryo implants into the uterus and begins to receive nutrients from the mother.

      <h2 class="qa-question">Short notes on Intraembryonic mesoderm and its derivatives.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The intraembryonic mesoderm is a layer of cells that forms during gastrulation between the
        endoderm and ectoderm. It gives rise to various structures and tissues in the developing embryo, including the
        notochord, somites, and mesodermal derivatives such as the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. The somites
        further differentiate into sclerotome (gives rise to vertebrae and ribs), myotome (gives rise to muscles), and
        dermatome (gives rise to dermis of the skin). The intraembryonic mesoderm also contributes to the formation of
        the body wall, limbs, and connective tissue.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">List the derivatives of ectoderm.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The ectoderm is one of the three germ layers that form during gastrulation in the developing
        embryo. It gives rise to various structures and tissues, including the skin, hair, nails, nervous system, and
        sensory organs. The derivatives of ectoderm include the epidermis, hair, nails, sweat glands, mammary glands,
        enamel of teeth, neural tube (forms the brain and spinal cord), neural crest cells (give rise to various tissues
        including sensory ganglia, adrenal medulla, and pigment cells), and sensory organs such as the eye and ear.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Give a brief overview of the embryonic period/ Period of Organogenesis.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The embryonic period, also known as the period of organogenesis, is the second period of
        prenatal development that lasts from the end of the germinal period to the end of the eighth week after
        fertilization. During this period, the major organs and organ systems of the body are formed, and the embryo
        takes on a recognizable human form. The embryonic period is characterized by rapid cell division, migration, and
        differentiation of cells to form the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and their derivatives.
        The heart begins to beat, and the major organ systems including the nervous system, cardiovascular system,
        respiratory system, digestive system, and urinary system start to form. Teratogens, such as drugs, alcohol, and
        infections, can cause significant damage to developing organs and lead to congenital abnormalities.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on neural crest cells.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Neural crest cells are a unique group of cells that originate from the dorsal neural tube
        during embryonic development. They have the ability to migrate extensively throughout the embryo and
        differentiate into various cell types, including sensory and autonomic neurons, glial cells, and a variety of
        non-neuronal cells such as pigment cells, adrenal chromaffin cells, and connective tissue cells. Neural crest
        cells play a critical role in the formation of many organs and structures in the body, including the cranial and
        spinal nerves, the craniofacial skeleton, and the cardiovascular system.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the structure of mature placenta. List the different types of abnormal placenta.
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The mature placenta is an organ that connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall,
        allowing for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the maternal and fetal circulatory
        systems. It consists of two main layers: the maternal side, which is formed by the uterine wall, and the fetal
        side, which is formed by the chorionic plate. The placenta also contains various structures such as chorionic
        villi, which increase the surface area available for exchange between maternal and fetal blood.
        Abnormal placenta can be classified into various types such as:

        Placenta previa: when the placenta is situated over the cervical opening, which can cause severe bleeding during
        delivery.
        Placenta accreta: when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, which can cause heavy bleeding
        during delivery and may require surgical intervention.
        Placental abruption: when the placenta separates from the uterine wall prematurely, which can cause fetal
        distress and heavy bleeding in the mother.</p>

        Features of mature placenta include:

        It is a disc-shaped organ that is about 20cm in diameter and 2-3cm thick.
        It is made up of about 15-20 lobes, each with its own blood supply.
        The maternal side is smooth and divided into lobes, while the fetal side is covered with chorionic villi.
        The placenta secretes hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estrogen, and progesterone, which

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on Trophoblastic villi.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Trophoblastic villi are finger-like projections that extend from the chorion into the uterine
        wall during pregnancy. These villi are responsible for the exchange of nutrients and gases between the mother
        and the developing fetus. They play a crucial role in the formation of the placenta and provide a large surface
        area for the exchange of materials. The trophoblastic villi also produce hormones such as human chorionic

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Give a suitable example of negative feedback mechanism.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">An example of negative feedback mechanism is the regulation of blood glucose levels. When
        blood glucose levels increase, insulin is released from the pancreas which promotes the uptake of glucose by
        cells and the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver. This causes a decrease in blood glucose levels, which
        in turn decreases the release of insulin. This feedback loop helps to maintain stable blood glucose levels

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">2) Define isotonic solution. Discuss the role of ionic channels in cellular function.
      </h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">An isotonic solution is a solution that has the same concentration of solutes as the solution
        it is compared to. Ionic channels are pore-forming proteins that allow ions to move across cell membranes. These
        channels play a critical role in maintaining the ionic balance of cells and are involved in numerous cellular
        functions including electrical signaling, muscle contraction, and secretion. Dysfunction of ionic channels can

        against their concentration gradient, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration,
        with the help of energy in the form of ATP. Active transport occurs through protein channels called pumps, which
        use the energy provided by ATP to move the substances across the membrane. Examples of active transport include
        the uptake of glucose by cells in the intestine and kidney, and the movement of ions such as sodium, potassium,

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define equilibrium potential and explain the ionic basis of action potential of a neuron.
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Equilibrium potential is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of ions across
        the membrane, and it is determined by the concentration gradient and the electrical gradient of the ions. The
        ionic basis of action potential in a neuron is due to the movement of ions across the cell membrane, which
        results in a change in membrane potential. During the resting state, the inside of the neuron is negatively
        charged relative to the outside, with a resting potential of about -70 mV. When a stimulus is applied, sodium
        ions enter the cell, causing depolarization of the membrane potential. This depolarization triggers the opening
        of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell, and a reversal of
        membrane potential. This is followed by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, leading to the efflux
        of potassium ions from the cell, and repolarization of the membrane potential to the resting state. The ionic
        basis of action potential ensures the transmission of electrical signals in neurons.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Draw a labeled diagram of action potential of a neuron and explain its ionic basis.
        Explain the refractory period.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The action potential of a neuron can be represented by a graph of the changes in membrane
        potential over time. The diagram includes three main phases: the resting state, depolarization, and
        repolarization. During the resting state, the membrane potential is about -70 mV. When a stimulus is applied,
        sodium channels open, causing an influx of sodium ions into the cell, leading to depolarization of the membrane
        potential. This depolarization triggers the opening of more sodium channels, leading to a rapid influx of sodium
        ions, and a reversal of membrane potential. This is followed by the opening of potassium channels, leading to
        the efflux of potassium ions, and repolarization of the membrane potential to the resting state. The refractory
        period is a period of time after the initiation of an action potential when the neuron is unable to generate
        another action potential. This is due to the inactivation of sodium channels during depolarization and
        repolarization. The refractory period ensures that the action potential propagates in one direction and prevents
        the neuron from generating a continuous stream of action potentials.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define the term resting membrane potential, Nernst potential, Refractory period and
        Chronaxie. Mention the ionic basis of nerve action potential.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Resting membrane potential is the electrical potential difference between the inside and the
        outside of the cell membrane of a resting neuron. Nernst potential is the electrochemical gradient across the
        cell membrane when the ion movement reaches equilibrium. Refractory period is a period of time after a neuron
        has fired an action potential where it is less likely to fire another action potential. Chronaxie is the minimum
        duration of a current of twice the strength of the rheobase needed to excite a nerve fiber. The ionic basis of
        nerve action potential is the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane, which causes a
        change in electrical potential and triggers the release of neurotransmitters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Define all or none law.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The all or none law states that when a neuron fires an action potential, it does so at full
        strength or not at all. If the stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold potential, an action potential
        will be generated, but if the stimulus is too weak, the neuron will not fire.</p>

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">Diagram of action potential of neuron and its ionic basis.</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">An action potential is a rapid and brief change in the membrane potential of a neuron. It
        consists of depolarization, repolarization, and a brief hyperpolarization phase. The ionic basis of action
        potential involves the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane. During depolarization,
        sodium ions enter the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more positive. This is followed by
        repolarization, where potassium ions exit the cell and the membrane potential returns to its resting value. The
        brief hyperpolarization phase occurs when potassium ions continue to leave the cell, causing the membrane
        potential to become more negative than the resting potential before it returns to its resting value.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Mention the differences between action potential and graded potential.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Action potential is a rapid and brief all-or-none depolarization of the membrane potential of
        excitable cells, including neurons and muscle cells, that travels along the length of the cell. It has a fixed
        amplitude, duration, and threshold, and is triggered by a depolarizing stimulus that reaches the threshold
        potential. Graded potential, on the other hand, is a slower and smaller change in the membrane potential that
        can be either depolarizing (excitatory) or hyperpolarizing (inhibitory), depending on the type and strength of
        the stimulus. It has a variable amplitude, duration, and threshold, and does not propagate along the cell. </p>

        b) Spatial summation: Spatial summation is the process by which multiple graded potentials generated at
        different synapses on a neuron are integrated to produce a larger depolarization that can reach the threshold
        for generating an action potential. The integration of graded potentials depends on the location and timing of
        the synapses, as well as the strength and type of the signals they generate. Spatial summation can be either
        additive, in which the depolarizations are simply summed up, or inhibitory, in which the depolarizations cancel
        each other out.

      <p class="qa-answer">
      <ol class="qa-list">
        <li><strong>Source of drugs:</strong> Drugs can be obtained from a variety of sources, including plants,
          animals, minerals, and synthetic chemicals. Plant-based drugs are derived from herbs, shrubs, trees, and other
          plants. Animal-based drugs are obtained from animals such as cows, pigs, horses, and even marine organisms.
          Mineral-based drugs are derived from minerals such as iron, lithium, and sulfur. Synthetic chemicals are made
          in the laboratory and are designed to mimic the effects of natural substances.</li>
        <li><strong>Dosage forms:</strong> Drugs come in many different dosage forms, including tablets, capsules,
          liquids, injections, patches, and inhalers. Tablets are the most common form of drug and are typically taken
          orally. Capsules are similar to tablets but are usually filled with a powder or liquid. Liquids can be taken
          orally or injected. Injections can be given intravenously (into a vein), intramuscularly (into a muscle), or
          subcutaneously (under the skin). Patches are applied to the skin and deliver drugs through the skin. Inhalers
          are used to deliver drugs directly to the lungs.</li>
        <li><strong>Routes of drug administration:</strong> Drugs can be administered through a variety of routes,
          including oral, topical, injectable, and inhalation. Oral drugs are taken by mouth and include tablets,
          capsules, and liquids. Topical drugs are applied to the skin and include creams, ointments, and patches.
          Injectable drugs are delivered through a needle and include intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous
          injections. Inhalation drugs are delivered through the respiratory system and include aerosols, nebulizers,

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the clinical significance of plasma half life of a drug.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Plasma half life of a drug refers to the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in
        the plasma to decrease by 50%. This parameter is important because it determines the duration of action of the
        drug, and also influences the dosing frequency required to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug. A drug with
        a short half life will need to be administered more frequently than a drug with a long half life. Additionally,
        a long half life may increase the risk of drug accumulation and toxicity, while a short half life may lead to
        subtherapeutic levels of the drug. Therefore, understanding the plasma half life of a drug is important for
        optimizing its therapeutic use and avoiding adverse effects.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">Microsomal enzyme inducers include drugs such as phenobarbital, rifampin, and carbamazepine,
        while inhibitors include drugs such as cimetidine, erythromycin, and ketoconazole. Biotransformation, which is
        the process by which drugs are metabolized and transformed in the body, serves several purposes. These include
        converting lipophilic drugs into more hydrophilic forms that can be excreted by the kidneys, inactivating drugs
        to reduce toxicity, and activating prodrugs to increase their effectiveness. Additionally, biotransformation can
        lead to drug interactions by altering the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that are metabolized by the same
        enzymes.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the plasma protein binding of drugs. Describe its clinical significance with
        suitable examples.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Many drugs bind to plasma proteins, particularly albumin, in the blood. This binding can
        affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug by reducing its free concentration and increasing its half life. It can
        also affect drug interactions, as drugs that compete for the same binding sites on plasma proteins may displace
        each other and alter their pharmacokinetics. Examples of drugs that are highly protein-bound include warfarin
        and phenytoin. In some cases, changes in protein binding can lead to altered drug response or toxicity. For
        example, in patients with hypoalbuminemia, there may be an increased risk of toxicity with highly protein-bound
        drugs because of their increased free concentrations in the blood. Therefore, understanding the plasma protein
        binding of drugs is important for optimizing their therapeutic use and avoiding adverse effects.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">Fat embolism syndrome (FES) occurs when fat globules enter the bloodstream and become lodged
        in small blood vessels. This can happen after a long bone fracture, especially in the femur or pelvis. The exact
        pathophysiology of FES is not fully understood, but it is thought that the fat globules cause mechanical
        obstruction of small blood vessels, leading to tissue damage and inflammation. Additionally, the fatty acids in
        the globules can activate clotting factors, which can lead to the formation of microclots throughout the body.
        Symptoms of FES can include shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and petechial rash on the chest and

      <h2 class="qa-question">Mention the different types of shock. Discuss the pathogenesis of septic shock.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">There are different types of shock, including hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock,
        neurogenic shock, and septic shock. Septic shock occurs when an infection leads to a systemic inflammatory
        response that results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and hypotension. This can cause
        inadequate tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and ultimately, multiple organ failure. The pathogenesis of
        septic shock involves the release of bacterial endotoxins and cytokines, which trigger the inflammatory
        response. The inflammatory mediators cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and activation of
        coagulation and complement pathways. The resulting hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion can lead to organ

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">List the causes of edema. Describe briefly the pathogenesis of edema.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Edema can be caused by various factors, including increased capillary hydrostatic pressure,
        decreased oncotic pressure, lymphatic obstruction, and increased capillary permeability. The pathogenesis of
        edema involves an imbalance between the forces that regulate fluid movement across the capillary wall. Under
        normal circumstances, there is a balance between the hydrostatic pressure, which tends to push fluid out of the
        capillaries, and the oncotic pressure, which tends to pull fluid into the capillaries. However, when there is an
        increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure or a decrease in oncotic pressure, fluid accumulates in the
        interstitial space, leading to edema. Additionally, if the lymphatic system is unable to drain the interstitial
        fluid, it can also contribute to edema formation.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the mechanism of chemical carcinogenesis.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Chemical carcinogenesis involves the conversion of normal cells into cancer cells through
        exposure to chemical agents that damage DNA or promote the growth of mutated cells. This can occur through a
        variety of mechanisms, including direct DNA damage, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications. Some
        chemical carcinogens can directly bind to DNA, causing structural changes that disrupt the normal DNA
        replication and repair processes. Other carcinogens can induce oxidative stress, which can damage DNA and other
        cellular components. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, can alter gene
        expression and promote the growth of mutated cells. The effects of chemical carcinogens can be influenced by
        factors such as the dose, duration, and timing of exposure, as well as individual genetic and environmental

        tissues, lymphatic spread, hematogenous spread, and transcoelomic spread. Direct invasion of adjacent tissues
        occurs when a tumor invades and destroys nearby tissues and organs. Lymphatic spread is when cancer cells travel
        through the lymphatic system to nearby lymph nodes and potentially to distant lymph nodes. Hematogenous spread
        occurs when cancer cells enter the bloodstream and can spread to distant organs. Transcoelomic spread occurs
        when cancer cells spread within body cavities, such as the peritoneal cavity or pleural cavity. </p>

      <p class="qa-answer">Cell-mediated immunity is a type of immune response that involves the activation of T
        lymphocytes, also known as T cells. T cells are responsible for recognizing and eliminating intracellular
        pathogens, such as viruses and intracellular bacteria, as well as cancer cells and foreign tissue grafts. The
        process of cell-mediated immunity begins when T cells recognize antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells,
        such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Upon activation, T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector
        cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells, which mediate the immune response. Cell-mediated immunity

        of glycogenolysis to form glucose. The glucose is then released into the bloodstream to maintain the blood sugar
        level. When glycogen stores are depleted, the body undergoes gluconeogenesis, a process in which glucose is
        synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and glycerol. The process of gluconeogenesis occurs

      <p class="qa-answer">The TCA cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle, is a series of biochemical
        reactions that occur in the mitochondria of cells. The cycle starts with the entry of acetyl CoA, derived from

        carbon dioxide, and reduced cofactors like NADH and FADH2. These cofactors are important for energy production
        in the electron transport chain, which occurs in the mitochondrial membrane. The TCA cycle is regulated by
        various enzymes and cofactors, including ATP, NADH, and succinyl CoA. The cycle is also regulated by the

        conditions.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down to produce energy in the form of
        ATP. The pathway of glycolysis involves ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which are divided into two stages: the
        energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase. In the energy investment phase, two ATP molecules are used
        to phosphorylate glucose, which is then converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. In the energy payoff phase,
        fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two three-carbon molecules, which are further metabolized to produce
        ATP, NADH, and pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the TCA cycle, which generates more ATP.
        However, in the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted to lactate through the process of fermentation, which
        produces ATP but at a much lower rate. The energy yield in aerobic conditions is higher, producing 38 ATP
        molecules per glucose molecule, while anaerobic conditions produce only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule.

        During the denaturation step, the DNA sample is heated to a high temperature to separate the double-stranded DNA
        into single strands.
        In the annealing step, the temperature is lowered to allow primers (short sequences of DNA that are
        complementary to the target sequence) to anneal to the single-stranded DNA.
        In the extension step, the temperature is raised again and a DNA polymerase enzyme extends the primers,

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define sterilization and disinfection. Describe the methods of sterilization.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Sterilization is the process of completely eliminating all forms of microbial life, including
        bacterial spores, from an object or environment. Disinfection, on the other hand, is the process of reducing the
        number of microorganisms to a level that is not harmful to public health. There are various methods of
        sterilization, including heat sterilization (autoclaving, dry heat sterilization), chemical sterilization
        (ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide), and radiation sterilization (gamma radiation, electron beam). Other methods
        of disinfection include using chemical disinfectants (such as bleach or alcohol) and UV radiation.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define sterilization. Describe the principle of autoclave.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Sterilization is the process of completely eliminating all forms of microbial life, including
        bacterial spores, from an object or environment. Autoclave is a commonly used method of sterilization in which
        steam under pressure is used to kill microorganisms. The principle of autoclave is based on the fact that
        microorganisms are killed at high temperatures and pressures. The autoclave works by increasing the pressure of
        the steam, which increases the temperature of the steam. This high temperature and pressure combination kills
        all microorganisms, including bacterial spores, present in the material being sterilized.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">Gram's stain is a differential staining technique used to differentiate bacterial species
        into two groups based on the differences in their cell walls. The principle of Gram's stain is to first apply
        crystal violet to the bacteria, followed by iodine, which locks the stain into the cell wall. The bacteria are
        then decolorized with alcohol, and finally counterstained with safranin. Gram positive bacteria retain the
        crystal violet stain, while gram negative bacteria lose the crystal violet stain and take up the counterstain.
        Examples of gram positive bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, while examples of
        gram negative bacteria include Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe primary and secondary immune responses.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The primary immune response is the initial immune response to an antigen. When an antigen
        enters the body for the first time, it is recognized as foreign by the immune system, and B cells and T cells
        are activated to produce antibodies and eliminate the antigen. The primary response takes time to develop,
        usually 7-10 days, and the antibody levels are relatively low.
        The secondary immune response occurs when the immune system encounters the same antigen for a second time.
        Memory B cells and T cells that were generated during the primary response are quickly activated and start
        producing antibodies. The secondary response is much faster and stronger than the primary response, with higher
        levels of antibodies produced. The secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which provides
        long-term protection against re-infection with the same pathogen.</p>

        molecular explanation.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive
        muscle weakness and degeneration. The disease is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which leads
        to the absence of the dystrophin protein in muscle cells. Dystrophin plays a crucial role in maintaining
        the structural integrity of muscle fibers.
        Correlation with calcium level can be explained by the fact that the absence of dystrophin disrupts the
        normal calcium signaling in muscle cells, leading to calcium overload and muscle damage.
        A possible molecular explanation is that the absence of dystrophin leads to increased permeability of
        the sarcolemma, which allows excessive entry of calcium ions into the cell, leading to oxidative stress
        and activation of proteolytic enzymes that degrade the muscle fibers. A diagram showing the molecular

      <p class="qa-answer">Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited muscle diseases that affect muscle function
        and weaken muscle strength over time. The genetic basis of muscular dystrophy is related to mutations in
        genes responsible for producing proteins involved in muscle structure and function. In particular,
        mutations in the dystrophin gene have been linked to the most common form of muscular dystrophy,
        Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The absence or abnormality of dystrophin protein causes muscle cells to
        become fragile and easily damaged, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting.
        Biochemical abnormalities associated with muscular dystrophy include increased levels of creatine
        kinase, a protein released into the bloodstream when muscle cells break down. Abnormalities in calcium
        homeostasis and oxidative stress have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

        Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D, which is synthesized in the kidneys. The synthesis of
        calcitriol is stimulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low levels of calcium in the blood.
        Calcitriol increases the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine and reabsorption of
        calcium and phosphate from the kidney. It also stimulates the release of calcium and phosphate from the

        certain types of cancer, and excessive intake of calcium or vitamin D supplements. Some of the diseases
        associated with hypercalcemia include:
        Hyperparathyroidism: This is a condition in which the parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid
        hormone, leading to increased levels of calcium in the blood.
        Cancer: Certain types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma and some types of lung cancer, can cause
        hypercalcemia by producing factors that increase calcium levels in the blood.
        Vitamin D toxicity: Excessive intake of vitamin D supplements can lead to hypercalcemia, as vitamin D
        stimulates the absorption of calcium from the intestine.
        Paget's disease: This is a condition in which there is abnormal bone remodeling, leading to increased
        release of calcium into the blood.
        Hyperthyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone,
        leading to increased bone turnover and release of calcium into the blood.
        The symptoms of hypercalcemia can include fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain, kidney stones, and

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of calcium in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction. [2063]
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Calcium plays a crucial role in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction. When an
        action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine is released, leading to the
        depolarization of the muscle fiber. This depolarization causes the release of calcium ions from the
        sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium then binds to the troponin on the actin filaments, leading to a
        conformational change in the tropomyosin that exposes the myosin-binding site on the actin. Myosin then
        binds to actin, forming a cross-bridge, which leads to muscle contraction. When the action potential
        ceases, calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to relaxation of the muscle
        fiber.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain in brief the hormone that regulate plasma calcium level. [2058]</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The hormones that regulate plasma calcium level are parathyroid hormone (PTH),
        calcitonin, and vitamin D. PTH is produced by the parathyroid glands and increases plasma calcium levels
        by stimulating osteoclast activity, which breaks down bone and releases calcium into the bloodstream.
        PTH also increases calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and decreases calcium excretion. Calcitonin is
        produced by the thyroid gland and lowers plasma calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and
        promoting calcium deposition in bone. Vitamin D, which is produced in the skin and converted to its
        active form in the liver and kidneys, increases plasma calcium levels by promoting calcium absorption in
        the intestines and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">The hormones that regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis are parathyroid hormone
        (PTH), calcitonin, and vitamin D. PTH increases plasma calcium levels by stimulating osteoclast
        activity, which breaks down bone and releases calcium into the bloodstream. PTH also increases calcium
        reabsorption in the kidneys and decreases phosphate reabsorption, leading to increased phosphate
        excretion. Calcitonin decreases plasma calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting
        calcium deposition in bone. Vitamin D increases plasma calcium levels by promoting calcium absorption in
        the intestines and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. Vitamin D also increases phosphate absorption in
        the intestines and reabsorption in the kidneys. These hormones work together to maintain the balance of
        calcium and phosphate in the body, which is important for many physiological processes such as bone
        formation, nerve and muscle function, and blood clotting.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Give the biochemical basis of: Thiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Thiazide diuretics are known to cause an increase in calcium levels in the blood,
        leading to hypercalcemia. This is due to their effect on the distal tubules of the kidneys, where they
        inhibit the reabsorption of calcium. As a result, more calcium remains in the urine and less is
        excreted, causing an increase in the concentration of calcium in the blood.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of hormone in calcium regulation.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Hormones play a crucial role in the regulation of calcium levels in the body. The
        parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin are two hormones that are involved in this process. PTH is
        released by the parathyroid glands in response to low calcium levels in the blood. It stimulates the
        release of calcium from the bones and increases the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. On the other
        hand, calcitonin is released by the thyroid gland in response to high calcium levels in the blood. It
        inhibits the release of calcium from the bones and promotes its excretion by the kidneys.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">List the different forms of calcium in the blood. How calcitriol maintains the blood
        calcium level.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">There are three main forms of calcium in the blood: ionized calcium, protein-bound
        calcium, and calcium complexed with anions such as bicarbonate and phosphate. Calcitriol, which is the
        active form of vitamin D, plays a key role in maintaining the blood calcium level. It increases the
        absorption of calcium from the intestines and stimulates the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. It
        also promotes the release of calcium from the bones. All of these actions help to maintain a stable
        level of calcium in the blood.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of vitamin D and Calcitriol in calcium and phosphate homeostasis.
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for the maintenance of calcium and
        phosphate homeostasis. It helps in the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine and their
        deposition in bones. In the kidneys, vitamin D is converted to its active form, Calcitriol. Calcitriol
        promotes the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the urine, thereby increasing their serum
        levels. Calcitriol also promotes bone resorption to maintain serum calcium levels. Therefore, vitamin D
        and Calcitriol play a crucial role in maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis.</p>

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the role of PTH and calcitriol in hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol play important roles in the regulation of
        serum calcium levels. In hypocalcemia, PTH is released from the parathyroid gland, which stimulates the
        release of calcium from bones, increases the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium from the kidneys, and
        activates vitamin D in the kidneys to increase the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the
        intestine. This results in an increase in serum calcium levels. On the other hand, in hypercalcemia, the
        secretion of PTH is inhibited, and the secretion of calcitonin is stimulated. Calcitonin inhibits bone
        resorption, increases the excretion of calcium and phosphate in urine, and decreases the absorption of
        calcium from the intestine, resulting in a decrease in serum calcium levels.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain the synthesis of calcitriol. Mention three causes of hypocalcemia and also
        explain their biochemical basis.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Calcitriol is synthesized from vitamin D in a series of reactions. First, vitamin D is
        converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. Then, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is
        converted to calcitriol in the kidneys by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase.
        Three causes of hypocalcemia are:

        Hypoparathyroidism, which is the deficiency of PTH secretion. PTH stimulates calcium release from bones,
        calcium reabsorption from the kidneys, and vitamin D activation in the kidneys. The deficiency of PTH
        results in decreased serum calcium levels.
        Vitamin D deficiency, which impairs calcium absorption from the intestine and leads to decreased serum
        calcium levels.
        Chronic kidney disease, which results in decreased production of calcitriol and impaired calcium and
        phosphate homeostasis.

      <p class="qa-answer">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is synthesized and secreted by the chief cells of the
        parathyroid glands. The synthesis of PTH is regulated by the level of ionized calcium in the blood. When
        the calcium level is low, the parathyroid glands increase the synthesis and secretion of PTH. PTH acts
        on the bones, kidneys, and intestines to increase calcium levels in the blood. Two causes of
        hypocalcemia are vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D deficiency reduces the
        absorption of calcium from the intestines, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.

      <p class="qa-answer">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system
        attacks the synovial lining of the joints, leading to chronic inflammation and destruction of the joint
        architecture. The exact cause of RA is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and
        environmental factors. The genetic factors include certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and
        other genes involved in immune function. The environmental factors include smoking, infections, and
        hormonal factors. The pathogenesis involves the activation of T and B cells, which produce
        autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). These
        antibodies target synovial tissue, leading to inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue destruction. The
        release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 further perpetuates the

        tophi and erosions in the joint cartilage and bone. The crystals are often seen under polarized light as
        needle-shaped and negatively birefringent. The acute attacks of gout are characterized by intense pain,
        swelling, and redness in the affected joint. The attacks often occur at night and can last for several
        days. Over time, chronic deposition of urate crystals in the joints can lead to joint damage and chronic
        arthritis. In advanced stages of the disease, tophi can develop, which are firm, chalky deposits of
        urate crystals that can be seen under the skin or in joints. Gout can also cause the development of
        renal stones due to the deposition of urate crystals in the kidneys. Treatment of gout involves the

          <li>
            <h3>a) Capsule and important ligament</h3>
            <p>The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation between the femur and the
              acetabulum of the hip bone. The joint is enclosed by a fibrous joint capsule that is
              reinforced

            <h3>b) Movement of muscles causing those movements.</h3>
            <p>The movements at the hip joint include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and
              lateral rotation. The flexion is mainly caused by the iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and
              sartorius
              muscles, while the extension is caused by the gluteus maximus and hamstrings. The adduction
              is
              caused by the adductor magnus, longus, and brevis muscles, and the abduction is caused by
              the
              gluteus medius and minimus muscles. The medial and lateral rotation are mainly caused by the

            <h3>a) Semitendinosus muscle:</h3>
            <p>
              The semitendinosus muscle is one of three muscles that make up the hamstrings muscle group.
              It
              is a long, thin muscle located at the back of the thigh. The muscle originates from the
              ischial
              tuberosity of the pelvis and inserts into the upper part of the tibia bone in the lower leg.

              The primary function of the semitendinosus muscle is to flex and medially rotate the leg at
              the
              knee joint. It also helps to extend the thigh at the hip joint and contributes to the
              stabilization of the knee joint.

              The muscle is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. It receives blood supply
              from the medial circumflex femoral artery and the inferior gluteal artery.

              The semitendinosus muscle is commonly involved in sports-related injuries, such as strains
              and
              tears. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help prevent these injuries and improve
              overall leg flexibility and strength.</p>

              cruciate
              ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The ACL is attached to the anterior
              intercondylar area of the tibia and the posterior part of the lateral condyle of the femur,
              while the PCL is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and the anterior
              part
              of the medial condyle of the femur. The main function of the cruciate ligaments is to
              stabilize

              lateral,
              and patellofemoral compartments. The articulating surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella
              are
              covered with articular cartilage, which provides smooth gliding movements. The menisci are
              two
              fibrocartilaginous structures located between the femur and tibia, which act as shock
              absorbers
              and enhance the stability of the knee joint. The cruciate ligaments and collateral ligaments
              provide additional stability to the knee joint. The four bursae around the knee joint are

        <p class="qa-answer">Skeletal muscle fibers are made up of myofibrils, which are composed of repeating
          units
          called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere contains two types of protein filaments: thick myosin filaments
          and
          thin actin filaments. The myosin filaments are located in the center of the sarcomere, while the
          actin
          filaments are located on either side of the myosin filaments. The light bands are composed of actin
          filaments, while the dark bands are composed of myosin filaments. The region where the light and
          dark
          bands meet is called the Z-line. The sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized type of endoplasmic
          reticulum, surrounds the myofibrils and stores calcium ions that are required for muscle
          contraction.

        <p class="qa-answer">The transmission of an impulse across the neuromuscular junction involves a series
          of
          events. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of a motor neuron, it triggers the release of a
          neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. The acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction
          and
          binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber. This binding causes a change in the
          permeability of the muscle fiber membrane, which results in the influx of sodium ions and the
          generation
          of an action potential. The action potential spreads along the muscle fiber membrane and triggers

          to adjust their behavioral responses to repeated stimuli. Habituation is the process by which an
          organism becomes less responsive to a stimulus after repeated exposure. This occurs when synaptic
          connections between sensory neurons and interneurons in the central nervous system become weaker
          over

        <p class="qa-answer">Synaptic transmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other
          through specialized junctions called synapses. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic
          terminal, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These
          neurotransmitters
          bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and cause a change in the membrane potential, either
          by
          depolarization or hyperpolarization. The strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons can
          be
          modified by a variety of factors, including changes in the number or sensitivity of receptors, as
          well

          the
          release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron. Acetylcholine then binds

        <p class="qa-answer">Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular

          receptors,
          which leads to a reduction in the number of available receptors for acetylcholine to bind to. As a
          result, the muscle fiber cannot generate enough force to contract, leading to muscle weakness and
          fatigue. The treatment for myasthenia gravis involves the use of anticholinesterase drugs that

          properties of a synapse.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a specialized junction between two nerve cells, where one neuron (the
          presynaptic neuron) releases a chemical neurotransmitter that binds to receptors on the postsynaptic
          neuron, transmitting the signal from one neuron to the next. Synaptic transmission occurs when an
          action
          potential reaches the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, causing the release of
          neurotransmitter
          molecules into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic
          neuron,
          leading to changes in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron that may generate an action
          potential.
          Four properties of a synapse are:

          Plasticity: the ability to change and adapt in response to changes in neuronal activity or
          experience.
          Spatial summation: the integration of signals from multiple presynaptic neurons at a single
          postsynaptic
          neuron.
          Temporal summation: the integration of signals from a single presynaptic neuron over time.

        <p class="qa-answer">The steps of muscular transmission are as follows:
          1. An action potential arrives at the axon terminal of a motor neuron.
          2. Acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft.
          3. ACh binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.
          4. This generates an action potential in the muscle fiber.
          5. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber, leading to muscle contraction.
          Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue,
          particularly
          in the muscles of the eyes, face, throat, and limbs. It is caused by the production of
          autoantibodies
          that target and destroy the ACh receptors on the motor end plate of muscle fibers, leading to a
          reduction in the number of functional receptors and impairing the transmission of nerve impulses to
          the
          muscle fibers. The symptoms of myasthenia gravis can be managed with medications that enhance the
          transmission of ACh, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or immunosuppressive therapies that

        <p class="qa-answer">Skeletal muscle contraction occurs when myosin and actin filaments slide over each
          other. This sliding is driven by the interaction between myosin heads and actin binding sites. The
          process is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the
          sarcoplasm,
          which binds to troponin and causes a conformational change that exposes the actin binding sites.
          This
          allows myosin heads to bind to the actin and undergo a power stroke, pulling the actin filaments
          towards
          the center of the sarcomere.
          Motor unit refers to a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor
          neuron
          fires, all the muscle fibers it innervates contract simultaneously. Rigor mortis is the stiffening
          of
          muscles that occurs after death due to the depletion of ATP, which is necessary for muscle
          relaxation.
          Without ATP, myosin heads cannot detach from actin, leading to a state of sustained muscle
          contraction.

        <p class="qa-answer">The steps of skeletal muscle contraction include excitation, excitation-contraction
          coupling, contraction, and relaxation. During excitation, an action potential propagates along the
          sarcolemma and down the T-tubules, leading to the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic
          reticulum. During excitation-contraction coupling, calcium ions bind to troponin, leading to the
          exposure of actin binding sites and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycle. During contraction,
          myosin
          heads bind to actin, undergo a power stroke, and slide the actin filaments towards the center of the
          sarcomere. During relaxation, calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing
          troponin to release actin and allowing the muscle to relax.

          Isometric contraction refers to muscle contraction without a change in muscle length, such as

          release of ADP and inorganic phosphate, which allows the myosin head to undergo a conformational
          change
          and slide the actin filament. ATP then binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin.
          The

          the
          sequence of events that occur during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle:
          Action potential arrives at the axon terminal of the motor neuron, causing voltage-gated calcium
          channels to open.
          Calcium ions enter the axon terminal, which triggers the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic
          cleft.
          Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the sarcolemma, causing ion channels to open and allowing sodium
          ions to enter the muscle fiber.
          This causes the sarcolemma to depolarize, generating an action potential that spreads along the
          T-tubules.
          The action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the
          sarcoplasm.
          Calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that exposes the myosin-binding sites
          on
          actin.
          Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges.
          ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, causing the myosin head to change conformation and pull the actin

        <p class="qa-answer">Calcium ions play a crucial role in the process of excitation-contraction coupling,
          which is the process by which an action potential triggers muscle contraction. When an action
          potential
          travels down a motor neuron and reaches the neuromuscular junction, it causes the release of the
          neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, causing
          depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the
          sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to a release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm of the muscle
          fiber.
          The calcium ions then bind to the protein complex troponin, which is part of the thin filament of
          the
          sarcomere. This binding causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex, which
          exposes the binding sites on the actin filament. This allows myosin heads to bind to actin, forming
          cross-bridges and initiating muscle contraction. In summary, calcium ions play a crucial role in the

          in a muscle. A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates.
          The
          size and number of motor units recruited depends on the force required by the muscle contraction.
          Small
          motor units are recruited first, followed by larger motor units as the force required increases.
          Motor
          unit recruitment is important for generating smooth and efficient muscle contractions, and is also
          involved in muscle adaptation to training and injury.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">Muscle spindles are sensory organs within skeletal muscles that help in sensing changes
        in
        muscle length and muscle tension. They are made up of specialized muscle fibers called intrafusal
        fibers,
        which are innervated by both sensory and motor neurons. The sensory neurons within muscle spindles are
        sensitive to changes in muscle length and tension. When the muscle is stretched, the sensory neurons
        within
        the muscle spindle send signals to the spinal cord, which in turn sends signals to the muscle to
        contract,
        thereby maintaining muscle tone. The diagram below illustrates the structure and function of a muscle

      <p class="qa-answer">Skeletal muscle tone is the continuous and partial contraction of muscles at rest,
        which
        provides resistance to passive movements. It is maintained by the tonic activity of motor neurons in the
        spinal cord, which stimulate muscle fibers to contract. Skeletal muscle tone helps maintain posture,

      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">a) Physiological basis of clonus and tetanic muscle contraction.</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Clonus is a rhythmic involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in response to
        sustained
        muscle stretch. It is caused by a hyperactive stretch reflex due to damage or dysfunction of the central
        nervous system. Tetanic muscle contraction is a sustained and maximal contraction of muscle fibers in
        response to high-frequency stimulation. It occurs due to the accumulation of intracellular calcium ions,
        which promote the binding of myosin and actin filaments and prolong the duration of contraction.</p>
      <h3 class="qa-subquestion">b) Oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers.</h3>
      <p class="qa-answer">Oxidative muscle fibers are slow-twitch fibers that rely primarily on aerobic
        metabolism to
        generate ATP. They contain large numbers of mitochondria, myoglobin, and oxidative enzymes, which allow
        them
        to sustain prolonged contractions without fatigue. Glycolytic muscle fibers are fast-twitch fibers that
        rely
        primarily on anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP. They contain fewer mitochondria, myoglobin, and
        oxidative
        enzymes, but have a higher concentration of glycolytic enzymes and can generate high levels of force
        rapidly. Skeletal muscles contain both types of fibers, but the proportion varies depending on the
        function

      <p class="qa-answer">Muscle tone refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of muscles at
        rest,
        which enables them to maintain their posture and resist passive stretching. Isometric contraction, on

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe in detail the structure and function of the muscle spindle.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">A muscle spindle is a sensory receptor located within the muscle that is responsible
        for
        detecting changes in muscle length and rate of change in length. It consists of several intrafusal
        muscle
        fibers surrounded by a capsule, which is innervated by sensory nerve fibers. The intrafusal muscle
        fibers
        are of two types: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers.
        The muscle spindle functions to provide sensory feedback to the central nervous system regarding muscle
        length and rate of change in length. When the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal muscle fibers within
        the
        spindle are also stretched, which activates the sensory nerve fibers within the capsule. These sensory
        fibers then send signals to the spinal cord and brain, providing information about the length and rate
        of
        change of the muscle.

        The muscle spindle also plays a critical role in maintaining muscle tone by detecting changes in muscle
        length and initiating reflexive muscle contractions to resist changes in length.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Explain supraspinal control of muscle tone.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Supraspinal control of muscle tone refers to the regulation of muscle tone by the
        central
        nervous system, specifically the brain and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord receive sensory
        information from muscle spindles and other sensory receptors and integrate this information with other
        motor
        commands to modulate muscle tone.
        The brain can exert its influence on muscle tone through descending pathways that originate from the
        motor
        cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These pathways regulate the excitability of spinal motor neurons,
        which in turn affects muscle tone. For example, the corticospinal tract from the motor cortex can
        influence
        the activity of spinal motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles, thereby modulating muscle tone.

        The supraspinal control of muscle tone is also influenced by other factors such as emotional state,
        stress,
        and fatigue. For example, stress can lead to increased muscle tension and elevated muscle tone, while
        fatigue can result in decreased muscle tone and reduced muscle function.</p>

        Depolarizing muscle relaxants, like succinylcholine, work by causing a sustained depolarization of the
        neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, like
        pancuronium, work by binding to the acetylcholine receptor, preventing the binding of acetylcholine and
        thereby blocking muscle contraction. Pancuronium can be reversed by administration of neostigmine, which
        inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine and allows it to compete with the non-depolarizing muscle

      <p class="qa-answer">Neostigmine and physostigmine are both acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase
        the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which improves muscle strength in
        myasthenia gravis. However, neostigmine is preferred over physostigmine because it has a shorter
        duration of action and fewer side effects. Neostigmine is hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase, while
        physostigmine is metabolized by hepatic enzymes, which leads to a longer duration of action and
        increased risk of side effects such as bradycardia, bronchospasm, and seizures. Neostigmine is also
        preferred for the treatment of myasthenic crisis due to its rapid onset and short duration of action.

        Selective COX-2 inhibitors have an advantage over non-selective COX inhibitors in that they have a lower
        risk of causing gastrointestinal side effects such as ulcers and bleeding. This is because COX-2
        inhibitors specifically target the COX-2 enzyme, which is involved in inflammation, without affecting

        effects of methotrexate.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis can be classified into several categories,
        including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
        and biologic agents. Methotrexate is a type of DMARD that works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme
        called dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the production of DNA and cell division. By
        inhibiting this enzyme, methotrexate reduces the proliferation of immune cells and the production of
        inflammatory cytokines, which helps to decrease inflammation and slow the progression of joint damage in
        rheumatoid arthritis.
        Some common adverse effects of methotrexate include nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, hair loss, and liver
        damage. Regular monitoring of blood counts and liver function is necessary to prevent serious side

        reducing inflammation in the body and is classified as a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
        It is believed to work by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, which are proteins that
        contribute to the inflammation and damage seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Some common adverse effects of
        sulfasalazine include gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as

        regimen that includes three antibiotics: rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone. This MDT regimen is
        usually given for a period of 12 months. In addition to medication, supportive care and monitoring of
        complications are also important. Patients with multi bacillary leprosy should be monitored closely for
        the development of nerve damage, skin ulcers, and other complications. Rehabilitation services, such as

        (MDT), that targets the bacteria responsible for the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)
        recommends a combination of rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone for the treatment of leprosy. The
        duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of leprosy, but typically lasts for six months to
        one year. Treatment can also involve surgery to correct deformities caused by the disease, as well as
        physical therapy and rehabilitation to restore function to affected areas of the body. Early diagnosis
        and treatment can help prevent the development of complications and the spread of the disease to others.

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the pathways followed by corticospinal tract. Enumerate the clinical features due
        to its lesion.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The corticospinal tract is the primary motor pathway for voluntary movement. It originates in
        the motor cortex of the brain, descends through the internal capsule, and then travels through the brainstem and
        spinal cord. The corticospinal tract is divided into the lateral corticospinal tract and the ventral
        corticospinal
        tract. The lateral corticospinal tract crosses over to the opposite side of the body at the level of the medulla
        oblongata, while the ventral corticospinal tract remains ipsilateral.
        Clinical features of a corticospinal tract lesion include spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia, and Babinski sign.
        Spastic paralysis is characterized by increased muscle tone and difficulty initiating movement, while
        hyperreflexia refers to an overactive reflex response. The Babinski sign is a reflex in which the big toe
        extends
        and the other toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stimulated. In a corticospinal tract lesion, this reflex
        becomes pathological and is present even in adults.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">In the nervous system, a tract refers to a bundle of nerve fibers that have a common origin
        and
        destination. Tracts are classified based on their function and location in the nervous system.
        The pathway for pain and temperature begins with the detection of these stimuli by specialized sensory receptors
        in the skin. The nerve fibers from these receptors synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the
        spinal cord. The second-order neurons then decussate, or cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord, and
        ascend through the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus.

        In the thalamus, the third-order neurons receive the sensory input and project to the primary somatosensory
        cortex
        in the parietal lobe. Here, the sensory information is processed and integrated to give rise to the sensation of
        pain or temperature. </p>

        sensations. The peripheral receptor sends the sensory signals through the dorsal roots of the spinal cord, which
        then synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn. The second-order neurons decussate to the opposite
        side
        and ascend the spinal cord through the dorsal columns to synapse with third-order neurons in the ventral

          the granule cell layer. The Purkinje cells are the largest neurons in the cerebellar cortex and are arranged
          in
          a single layer between the molecular and granule cell layers. The granule cells are the smallest neurons in
          the
          cerebellum and are located in the granule cell layer. The white matter of the cerebellum contains myelinated
          axons that connect the different regions of the cerebellar cortex and connect the cerebellum to other parts of
          the brain.</p>
        <h3 class="qa-subquestion">b) Two important afferent and two efferent fibers</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">The cerebellum receives afferent fibers from two important sources: the mossy fibers and
          the
          climbing fibers. The mossy fibers originate from the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex and synapse
          onto granule cells in the cerebellar cortex. The climbing fibers originate from the inferior olive in the
          brainstem and synapse directly onto Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. The cerebellum sends efferent
          fibers to two main targets: the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and the thalamus. The fibers that project
          to
          the vestibular nuclei are involved in the maintenance of balance and coordination of eye movements, while the
          fibers that project to the thalamus are involved in motor planning and execution.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">The auditory pathway is responsible for processing sound information and transmitting it
          from
          the ear to the brain. It starts with the outer ear, which captures sound waves and directs them into the ear
          canal. The sound waves then travel to the middle ear, where they vibrate the eardrum and the ossicles, three
          small bones that amplify the vibrations. These vibrations are then transmitted to the inner ear, where they
          stimulate hair cells in the cochlea, a snail-shaped structure. The hair cells convert the mechanical
          vibrations
          into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve
          synapses in the cochlear nucleus of the brainstem, and from there, the auditory information is relayed to
          various brain regions, including the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and the auditory

        <h2 class="qa-question">6) Trace the visual pathway and correlate with different types of Anopias.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The visual pathway is responsible for processing visual information and transmitting it
          from
          the eyes to the brain. It starts with the retina, where light is converted into electrical signals by
          photoreceptor cells. These signals are transmitted to the bipolar cells, which in turn transmit them to the
          ganglion cells. The axons of the ganglion cells converge at the optic disc, where they form the optic nerve.
          The
          optic nerve carries the visual information from the eye to the brain. The optic nerve fibers from both eyes
          then
          join at the optic chiasm, where they partially cross over to the opposite side of the brain. The fibers that
          originate from the nasal retina cross over, while the fibers that originate from the temporal retina do not
          cross over. The fibers then continue on as the optic tract and terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus in
          the thalamus. From there, the visual information is transmitted to the primary visual cortex in the occipital
          lobe.
          Different types of anopias can occur depending on where along the visual pathway the damage occurs. For
          example,
          damage to the optic nerve can result in monocular blindness, while damage to the optic chiasm can result in
          bitemporal hemianopia. Lesions in the optic tract or lateral geniculate nucleus can result in homonymous
          hemianopia, where the loss of vision affects one side of the visual field in both eyes.</p>

          course, extracranial course and its's branches. Also mention the efferent of facial nerve lesions.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The facial nerve is the seventh cranial nerve and has both sensory and motor components. It
          originates from the brainstem and has a complex intracranial and extracranial course.
          Intracranially, the facial nerve arises from the pons and has motor, sensory, and parasympathetic fibers. The
          motor fibers innervate the muscles of facial expression, while the sensory fibers transmit taste information
          from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The parasympathetic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland,
          submandibular gland, and sublingual gland.

          Extracranially, the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland,
          where it branches into five main branches: temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical. The
          temporal branch supplies the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles. The zygomatic branch supplies the
          orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus muscles. The buccal branch supplies the buccinator muscle and the upper lip
          muscles. The marginal mandibular branch supplies the muscles of the lower lip and chin. The cervical branch
          supplies the platysma muscle.

          Lesions of the facial nerve can result in a variety of efferents, depending on the location and extent of the
          lesion. If the lesion occurs in the intracranial portion of the nerve, it can result in facial paralysis, loss
          of taste sensation, and dry eyes due to decreased tear production. If the lesion occurs in the extracranial
          portion of the nerve, it can result in weakness or paralysis of the muscles of facial expression on the
          affected
          side of the face, drooping of the corner of the mouth, and difficulty closing the eye. Lesions can also cause
          hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) and loss of the corneal reflex (the normal blinking response to a
          touch on the cornea).

        <p class="qa-answer">Axonal transport is the process by which materials are transported along the length of an
          axon, the long extension of a neuron. There are two main types of axonal transport: anterograde transport,
          which
          moves materials from the cell body toward the axon terminal, and retrograde transport, which moves materials
          from the axon terminal toward the cell body. This transport occurs along microtubules and is mediated by motor
          proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, which carry cargo along the microtubules. Axonal transport is essential
          for the maintenance and function of neurons, as it allows for the transport of important molecules
          such as proteins, lipids, and organelles, to and from the cell body and axon terminal. For example,
          neurotransmitters and their associated enzymes are synthesized in the cell body and must be transported down
          the
          axon to the terminal where they can be released into the synapse. Similarly, mitochondria, which are
          responsible
          for producing ATP, must be transported to the site of energy consumption in the axon terminal. Axonal
          transport
          can be disrupted in certain neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the accumulation of toxic proteins and
          organelles and contributing to the degeneration of neurons.

          makes it harder for the neuron to generate an action potential. It occurs when inhibitory neurotransmitters
          bind

          efflux
          of positively charged ions (such as K+). This makes the inside of the neuron more negative or the outside more
          positive, reducing the likelihood of an action potential being generated.</p>

          b) EPSP: EPSP stands for excitatory postsynaptic potential, which is a type of synaptic potential that makes

          c) Excitatory synaptic transmission: Excitatory synaptic transmission is a process in which an action
          potential
          in the presynaptic neuron leads to the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, which bind
          to

        <p class="qa-answer">Local potentials are graded changes in membrane potential that occur in response to
          neurotransmitter binding or sensory stimuli. They can be either depolarizing (EPSP) or hyperpolarizing (IPSP)
          and are conducted decrementally, meaning they lose strength as they travel along the neuron. They can also
          summate, meaning multiple inputs can add together to reach the threshold for an action potential. In contrast,

        <h2 class="qa-question">Define a synapse. List the stages in synaptic transmission. Describe briefly synaptic
          inhibition.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a specialized junction between two nerve cells or between a nerve cell and its
          target, where electrical or chemical signals are transmitted. There are four stages in synaptic transmission:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Presynaptic events:</strong> Action potentials arrive at the presynaptic terminal, resulting in
            the
            opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and the influx of calcium ions into the terminal.</li>
          <li><strong>Neurotransmitter release:</strong> The calcium influx triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles
            with
            the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft.</li>
          <li><strong>Postsynaptic events:</strong> The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and
            bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to the opening or closing of ion channels and the
            generation of a postsynaptic potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The neurotransmitter is either taken back up into the presynaptic terminal
            or
            broken down by enzymes in the synaptic cleft.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Synaptic inhibition is a process by which the transmission of signals across a synapse is decreased. It can
          occur through various mechanisms, such as presynaptic inhibition, where the release of neurotransmitter from
          the
          presynaptic terminal is reduced, or postsynaptic inhibition, where the responsiveness of the postsynaptic cell
          to the neurotransmitter is decreased.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">Write short notes on axonal transport.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Axonal transport is the process by which proteins, organelles, and other materials are
          transported along the axon of a neuron. There are two main types of axonal transport: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anterograde transport:</strong> This is the movement of materials from the cell body to the axon
            terminal, and is mediated by motor proteins such as kinesin.</li>
          <li><strong>Retrogade transport:</strong> This is the movement of materials from the axon terminal to the cell
            body, and is mediated by motor proteins such as dynein.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Axonal transport is essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of neurons, as it allows for the
          delivery of essential materials such as neurotransmitters and mitochondria to different parts of the neuron.
          Disruptions in axonal transport have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's
          disease and Huntington's disease.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">A synapse is a junction between two neurons or between a neuron and an effector cell, such
          as
          a muscle or gland. There are two main types of synapses: chemical synapses and electrical synapses. Chemical
          synapses are more common and involve the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron, which bind
          to
          receptors on the postsynaptic neuron or effector cell. Electrical synapses are less common and involve the
          direct transfer of electrical signals between the cells through gap junctions.
          The steps of synaptic transmission are:

          Action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal
          Calcium ions enter the presynaptic terminal
          Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft
          Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron or effector cell
          Ion channels open, leading to a change in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell
          Neurotransmitters are either broken down or taken back up by the presynaptic neuron for recycling
          Renshaw cell inhibition is a type of inhibitory feedback circuit that involves the release of glycine from
          Renshaw cells in the spinal cord. When a motor neuron fires, it activates a Renshaw cell, which then releases
          glycine onto the motor neuron's dendrites. This causes the motor neuron to be inhibited, preventing excessive
          contraction of the muscle it innervates.</p>

            nerve, which is the main parasympathetic nerve to the heart, releases acetylcholine onto the SA and AV
            nodes,

          increasing heart rate and cardiac output, dilating the airways in the lungs to increase oxygen supply,
          increasing blood glucose levels, and decreasing digestive activity. It also causes pupil dilation for improved
          vision, increases sweat production for cooling, and redirects blood flow to the skeletal muscles.
          Additionally,

          a) <strong>Synapse:</strong> A synapse is a junction between two nerve cells or between a nerve cell and an
          effector cell, where information is transmitted from one cell to the other through the release and reception
          of
          neurotransmitters. An example of a synapse is the neuromuscular junction, where a motor neuron communicates
          with
          a muscle cell to produce muscle contraction.

          Copy code
          b) <strong>Motor unit:</strong> A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates.
          When the motor neuron is activated, all the muscle fibers in its motor unit contract together. An example of a
          motor unit is the group of muscle fibers controlled by a single motor neuron in the biceps brachii muscle.

          c) <strong>Tetanus:</strong> Tetanus is a sustained contraction of a muscle caused by repeated stimulation of
          the motor neurons that innervate it. An example of tetanus is the lockjaw caused by the bacterial infection of
          Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that causes uncontrolled muscle contractions.

          d) <strong>Neurotransmitter:</strong> A neurotransmitter is a chemical substance released by a neuron at a
          synapse, which binds to receptors on the target cell and modulates its activity. An example of a
          neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which is released by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction to

        <h2 class="qa-question">Trace the pathway for pain sensation from receptor in the skin and brain.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Pain sensation begins with the activation of nociceptors, specialized sensory receptors
          that
          respond to noxious stimuli. Nociceptors are located in the skin and other tissues throughout the body. When a
          noxious stimulus is detected, the nociceptor sends an electrical signal through its axon to the spinal cord.
          The

          signal
          up to the brain through a pathway called the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract ascends through the
          spinal cord and synapses in the thalamus, which then relays the signal to the somatosensory cortex for
          conscious
          perception of pain. In addition to the spinothalamic tract, pain signals also activate other pathways that can

        <h2 class="qa-question">Define proprioception. Describe the pathway which carries this sensation from the
          periphery to the brain. Name one disease which damages this tract.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Proprioception is the sense of the position and movement of our body parts, including the
          limbs, joints, and muscles. It allows us to have awareness of our body in space without relying on vision.
          Proprioceptive information is carried by proprioceptors, which are sensory receptors located in muscles,
          tendons, and joints. The pathway for proprioception starts in the periphery and travels through the dorsal
          root
          ganglion and dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla oblongata, where it crosses over to the opposite
          side in the medullary pyramids. From there, it ascends to the thalamus and then to the primary somatosensory
          cortex for processing. A disease that damages this tract is tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of
          neurosyphilis that affects the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, leading to a loss of proprioception and
          balance problems.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Thermal sensation is carried from the periphery to the center via the spinothalamic tract.
          The spinothalamic tract is a neural pathway that transmits information about pain, temperature, and crude
          touch
          from the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain. The sensory neurons that detect thermal stimuli have free
          nerve endings that are sensitive to changes in temperature. These neurons transmit the information to the
          dorsal
          root ganglion, where the cell bodies of the sensory neurons are located. The axons of the sensory neurons
          enter
          the spinal cord and synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn. The second-order neurons cross the
          midline of the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral spinothalamic tract to the thalamus. The thalamus
          relays the information to the somatosensory cortex, where the sensation of temperature is perceived.</p>

          carries fine touch, proprioception, and vibration sense information from the periphery to the brain. The
          fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus are the two tracts that make up the posterior column, with the
          gracilis tract carrying information from the lower limbs and the cuneatus tract carrying information from the

        <h2 class="qa-question">Pyramidal vs. Extrapyramidal System</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The pyramidal system, also known as the corticospinal tract, is responsible for voluntary
          motor control of the body. It originates in the motor cortex of the brain and descends through the brainstem
          and
          spinal cord. The extrapyramidal system, on the other hand, consists of several different motor pathways that
          originate in the brainstem and modulate motor function. It is responsible for involuntary movements and
          postural
          control. While the pyramidal system is involved in fine, precise movements such as writing, the extrapyramidal

          roles. The cerebellum is responsible for fine-tuning movement and coordinating motor activity. It receives
          input
          from sensory systems and compares intended movement with actual movement, making adjustments as necessary. The
          basal ganglia, on the other hand, are involved in initiating and regulating movement, as well as learning and
          habit formation. They receive input from various areas of the brain, including the cortex and thalamus, and

          "upside-down" manner, with larger areas of representation given to body parts that require more precise and
          intricate movement, such as the hands and face. The physiological significance of the motor homunculus lies in
          its role in the control of voluntary movement. By mapping out the motor cortex, scientists can better
          understand
          how the brain controls movement and how different parts of the body are represented in the brain. This

          between heat gain and heat loss. It acts as a thermostat and receives input from temperature-sensitive neurons
          located in the skin and organs. If the body temperature rises, the hypothalamus initiates sweating, dilation
          of
          blood vessels in the skin, and other mechanisms that promote heat loss. If the body temperature falls, the
          hypothalamus triggers shivering, constriction of blood vessels in the skin, and other mechanisms that conserve
          heat. This delicate balance is essential for maintaining a stable body temperature, which is necessary for the

          temperature, appetite and thirst, sleep-wake cycles, autonomic nervous system, emotional responses, and the
          release of hormones from the pituitary gland.
          Hypothalamic obesity is a type of obesity that occurs due to damage to the hypothalamus, often as a result of
          surgery or injury. It is characterized by uncontrolled weight gain, especially in the abdominal region,
          despite
          a decrease in food intake and an increase in physical activity. The basis of hypothalamic obesity lies in the
          disruption of the hypothalamus's control over appetite and metabolism. Damage to the hypothalamus can lead to
          a
          decrease in the levels of hormones that regulate hunger, such as leptin, and an increase in the levels of
          hormones that stimulate appetite, such as ghrelin. Additionally, damage to the hypothalamus can lead to a
          decrease in energy expenditure and a decrease in the body's ability to burn calories. </p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">How sensory transduction of vision takes place? Describe with a neat diagram.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Sensory transduction of vision takes place in the retina of the eye. The retina contains
          photoreceptor cells called rods and cones that are responsible for detecting light and converting it into
          electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. When light enters the eye, it is
          first
          focused by the cornea and lens onto the retina. The light then passes through several layers of cells in the
          retina before reaching the photoreceptor cells.
          The photoreceptor cells contain a protein called rhodopsin, which consists of a protein molecule called opsin
          and a light-sensitive molecule called retinal. When light hits the retinal molecule, it changes shape and
          triggers a series of chemical reactions that generate an electrical signal in the photoreceptor cell. This
          electrical signal is then transmitted to other cells in the retina and eventually to the brain, where it is
          interpreted as visual information.

          The diagram below shows a simplified version of the visual transduction pathway:</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">Define photo transduction. Enumerate reflex response mediated through visual pathway.
        </h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Phototransduction is the process by which light is detected and converted into electrical
          signals in the retina of the eye. This process is carried out by photoreceptor cells called rods and cones,
          which contain light-sensitive pigments that change shape when they absorb light.
          Reflex responses mediated through the visual pathway include:

          Pupillary reflex: This is a reflex response that causes the pupils of the eye to constrict in response to
          bright
          light. This reflex is mediated by the optic nerve and involves the contraction of muscles in the iris.

          Accommodation reflex: This reflex response allows the eye to adjust its focus to see objects at different
          distances. It is mediated by the oculomotor nerve and involves the contraction of muscles in the ciliary body
          and lens of the eye.

          Optokinetic reflex: This reflex response helps to stabilize visual images during movement by causing the eyes
          to
          move in the opposite direction of a moving visual stimulus. It is mediated by the vestibular and oculomotor
          nerves.</p>

        <h3 class="qa-question-sub">a) Function of the middle ear.</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">The middle ear is a small air-filled space located behind the eardrum. It contains three
          tiny
          bones called ossicles, which are responsible for transmitting sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner
          ear. The middle ear also helps to regulate air pressure in the inner ear and protects the inner ear from loud
          sounds.</p>
        <h3 class="qa-question-sub">b) Conductive deafness</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">Conductive deafness is a type of hearing loss that occurs when sound waves are blocked from
          reaching the inner ear. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a build-up of earwax, a
          perforated
          eardrum, or damage to the ossicles in the middle ear. Conductive deafness can often be treated with medication

          a
          "brush-like" appearance. Hari cells play a role in sensing and responding to various stimuli, such as
          irritants

          as
          earwax buildup, fluid in the middle ear, damage to the eardrum or ossicles, or abnormalities in the structure
          of
          the outer or middle ear. Unlike sensorineural deafness, which is caused by damage to the hair cells in the
          inner
          ear, conduction deafness can often be treated with medical or surgical interventions, such as antibiotics,
          earwax removal, or reconstructive surgery of the middle ear.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">g) Function of middle ear</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">The middle ear is an air-filled cavity located between the outer and inner ear. It contains
          three small bones known as the ossicles, which are the malleus, incus, and stapes. The function of the middle
          ear is to transmit and amplify sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. When sound waves enter the
          ear, they cause the eardrum to vibrate, which in turn causes the ossicles to vibrate. The ossicles amplify the
          sound vibrations and transmit them to the inner ear, where they are converted into electrical signals that the
          brain can interpret as sound.</p>

        <h2 class="qa-question">h) Impedance matching and attenuation reflex</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Impedance matching and attenuation reflex are two important functions of the middle ear.
          Impedance matching refers to the process by which the middle ear amplifies sound vibrations to overcome the
          impedance, or resistance, of the inner ear fluids. This is necessary because the air-filled middle ear and the
          fluid-filled inner ear have different acoustic impedances. The ossicles of the middle ear act as a lever
          system
          to increase the force of the sound vibrations and reduce the impedance mismatch between the two regions.
          The attenuation reflex is a protective mechanism that reduces the amount of sound entering the inner ear when
          it
          becomes too loud. This reflex is mediated by the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles, which are attached to
          the
          ossicles. When sound levels become too high, these muscles contract to dampen the movement of the ossicles and
          reduce the amount of sound transmitted to the inner ear. This helps to protect the delicate structures of the
          inner ear from damage due to loud noises.</p>

          Acute pyogenic meningitis is caused by bacteria that enter the central nervous system through the bloodstream
          or
          via direct extension from a contiguous focus of infection. Once the bacteria enter the subarachnoid space,
          they

          malignancy. Grade I astrocytomas are the least aggressive, while grade IV astrocytomas, also known as
          glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are the most aggressive.
          GBM is characterized by microvascular proliferation, pseudopalisading necrosis, and nuclear atypia.
          Microvascular proliferation refers to the formation of small blood vessels within the tumor that supply it
          with
          nutrients. Pseudopalisading necrosis is a pattern of tumor cell death that leads to the formation of areas of
          dead cells surrounding blood vessels. Nuclear atypia refers to the abnormal appearance of the nuclei of tumor
          cells.

          Complications of GBM include seizures, neurological deficits, cognitive impairment, and increased intracranial
          pressure. </p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Anaplastic astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that arises from astrocytes, which are
          star-shaped cells in the brain that provide support to nerve cells. It is a grade III tumor, meaning it is
          considered a high-grade or malignant tumor. Anaplastic astrocytomas grow rapidly and invade nearby brain
          tissue.
          They can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and changes in behavior or personality. Treatment
          typically
          involves surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, anaplastic astrocytomas
          are often difficult to treat and have a poor prognosis.</p>

          glioblastoma
          multiforme.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Tumors of the central nervous system can be classified as either primary or secondary.
          Primary tumors originate in the brain or spinal cord, while secondary tumors originate elsewhere in the body
          and
          metastasize to the brain or spinal cord. Primary central nervous system tumors can be further classified based
          on their cell of origin and the degree of malignancy. Examples of primary central nervous system tumors
          include
          gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas.
          Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of malignant glioma, which is a primary tumor that arises from glial cells
          in
          the brain. It is the most aggressive and malignant form of glioma, with a very poor prognosis. Glioblastoma
          multiforme is characterized by a highly infiltrative growth pattern, meaning it invades nearby brain tissue,
          and
          by the presence of necrosis and pseudopalisading cells. Necrosis is the death of cells or tissue, while
          pseudopalisading cells are tumor cells that line up around areas of necrosis. The tumor also often has areas
          of
          hemorrhage and a heterogeneous appearance on imaging studies.</p>

          commonly found in insecticides and nerve agents. Organophosphorus compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase,
          leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Pralidoxime
          reactivates acetylcholinesterase by removing the phosphate group that is added by organophosphorus compounds,
          thus restoring normal cholinergic neurotransmission. However, Pralidoxime is only effective if administered

          respiratory distress, and potentially fatal cardiovascular collapse. Adrenaline acts on alpha-1 adrenergic
          receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure. It also acts on beta-2
          adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation and improving breathing. Additionally, adrenaline

          anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic properties. However, their long-term use can lead to physical and
          psychological dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Benzodiazepines can also cause
          adverse
          effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, and respiratory depression, especially in the
          elderly

        <h2 class="qa-question">List benzodiazepines. What is their mechanism of action? List indications to their use.
          What are their adverse effects.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that act as positive allosteric modulators of the
          gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
          system. The binding of benzodiazepines to the GABA receptor enhances the affinity of GABA for the receptor,
          leading to increased chloride ion influx into the neuron and hyperpolarization of the cell, resulting in
          anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects. Common benzodiazepines include alprazolam, clonazepam,
          diazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam. They are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, insomnia, seizures, and
          muscle spasms. Adverse effects of benzodiazepines include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, and
          respiratory depression. Long-term use can lead to physical and psychological dependence and withdrawal
          symptoms.

        <p class="qa-answer">Benzodiazepines are preferred to barbiturates as hypnosedatives because they have a wider
          therapeutic index, meaning they have a lower risk of causing respiratory depression and overdose compared to
          barbiturates. Benzodiazepines also have a lower potential for physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms
          compared to barbiturates. In addition, benzodiazepines have a shorter duration of action and less tolerance
          development compared to barbiturates, making them a safer and more effective choice for treating insomnia and

        <p class="qa-answer">Benzodiazepines are a class of medications that act as central nervous system depressants.
          They are commonly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and muscle spasms. Benzodiazepines work by
          enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps to reduce neuronal
          excitability and produce sedation, muscle relaxation, and anxiolytic effects.</p>

          their
          onset and duration of action, potency, lipid solubility, and metabolism. Some benzodiazepines are
          short-acting,
          such as lorazepam and alprazolam, while others are long-acting, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. The
          choice of benzodiazepine may depend on the specific indication for use, the patient's medical history, and

        <p class="qa-answer">Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. The basis of their use
          in this condition is their ability to block dopamine receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is associated with
          an
          excess of dopamine activity in certain areas of the brain, and antipsychotic drugs help to reduce this
          activity,
          leading to a reduction in the positive symptoms of the condition, such as hallucinations and delusions.</p>

        <p class="qa-answer">Depression is a common mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of
          interest or pleasure, feelings of worthlessness, and impaired functioning. Treatment for depression can
          involve
          a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy
          (IPT) are two effective forms of psychotherapy for depression. Antidepressant medications, such as selective
          serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic
          antidepressants (TCAs), can also be used to treat depression.</p>

        <h3 class="qa-subquestion">2) Give the basis of use of antidepressants.</h3>

        <p class="qa-answer">Antidepressants are used to treat depression and other related conditions, such as anxiety
          disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). They work by increasing the levels of certain
          neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, which are involved in regulating mood.
          Antidepressants can take several weeks to start working, and their effectiveness varies from person to person.
          Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are one class of antidepressant medication that are still used, although they
          have largely been replaced by newer, more selective medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs. TCAs work by blocking
          the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain.</p>
        <h4 class="qa-subsubquestion">a) Tricyclic antidepressants</h4>
        <p class="qa-answer">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of antidepressant medication that were first
          developed in the 1950s. They work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing
          their availability in the brain. TCAs can be effective in treating depression, but they are associated with a
          number of adverse effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and dizziness. They can also be
          toxic in overdose. Because of these side effects, TCAs are less commonly used than newer antidepressant

        E. Neuron and Synaptic transmission</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for many functions in the body,
        including muscle contraction, memory, and learning. It acts by binding to specific receptors on the surface of
        cells, triggering a series of chemical and electrical events that result in the desired effect. Na+-K+ ATPase,
        on
        the other hand, is an enzyme that is responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient of cells by
        pumping
        sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell. This is critical for proper neuronal function, as
        it
        ensures that the cell can maintain its resting membrane potential and properly fire action potentials.</p>

        2. Describe the mechanism of synthesis of acetylcholine, its function and degradation at neuromuscular junction.
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron from choline and
        acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The acetylcholine is then packaged into vesicles
        and transported to the presynaptic membrane, where it can be released in response to an action potential. Once
        released, acetylcholine binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle fiber, triggering a series of events that
        lead
        to muscle contraction. Acetylcholine is rapidly degraded in the synaptic cleft by the enzyme
        acetylcholinesterase,
        which breaks it down into choline and acetate. The choline is then transported back into the presynaptic neuron
        for reuse in acetylcholine synthesis. Dysfunction in acetylcholine synthesis, release, or degradation can result
        in a range of neuromuscular disorders.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the function of acetylcholine and Na+-K+ ATPase.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the transmission of nerve
        impulses. It is involved in the contraction of skeletal muscles, the regulation of the heartbeat, the
        stimulation
        of glandular secretions, and the activation of the central nervous system. Na+-K+ ATPase is an enzyme that
        maintains the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. It pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for
        every two potassium ions pumped into the cell, thereby creating a net negative charge inside the cell.</p>

      <p class="qa-answer">The biosynthesis of acetylcholine in the myoneural junction involves the enzyme choline
        acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the synthesis of acetylcholine from acetyl-CoA and choline. Once released
        into
        the synaptic cleft, acetylcholine is rapidly degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks it down

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe the mechanism of synthesis of acetylcholine, its function, and degradation at the
        neuromuscular junction.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The synthesis of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction begins with the uptake of
        choline
        from the extracellular fluid into the nerve terminal. Once inside, choline is acetylated by the enzyme choline
        acetyltransferase, using acetyl-CoA as a substrate. The resulting acetylcholine is then stored in vesicles
        within
        the nerve terminal until it is released in response to an action potential.
        Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter, binding to nicotinic receptors on the motor endplate of skeletal
        muscle fibers, causing depolarization and subsequent contraction of the muscle. Following release, acetylcholine
        is rapidly degraded by acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes the acetylcholine molecule into choline and
        acetate.
        The choline is then transported back into the nerve terminal for reuse in the synthesis of new acetylcholine.

        organophosphate compounds, which are commonly used in pesticides and insecticides. The major biochemical
        derangement in organophosphate poisoning is inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which normally
        breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in the synaptic cleft. When AChE is inhibited, ACh
        accumulates in the synaptic cleft and overstimulates cholinergic receptors, leading to symptoms such as
        excessive
        salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and seizures. If left untreated,

        membrane. The opening and closing of ion channels is regulated by various factors, such as the membrane
        potential,
        the presence of ligands or neurotransmitters, and mechanical forces. When an ion channel opens, ions flow down
        their electrochemical gradient, either into or out of the cell, depending on the concentration gradient and the
        charge of the ion. This movement of ions can change the membrane potential and trigger various cellular

      <h2 class="qa-question">Short notes on snake venom.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        Snake venom is a complex mixture of proteins and enzymes produced by venomous snakes. It is primarily used for
        prey capture and defense against predators. The mechanism of action of snake venom varies depending on the type
        of
        venom and the target organism.
        <br><br>
        <b>Explain the mechanism of action of snake venom:</b>
        Snake venom can act on various targets in the body such as the nervous system, cardiovascular system, and blood
        coagulation system. It can cause paralysis, hypotension, and bleeding disorders in the victim. Some venoms also
        have cytotoxic or hemotoxic effects, causing tissue damage or destruction of red blood cells.
        <br><br>
        <b>Inhibitory function of snake venom:</b>
        Snake venom can also have inhibitory functions. For example, some venoms contain proteins that block the
        transmission of nerve impulses, leading to paralysis of the prey. Other venoms contain anticoagulant proteins
        that
        prevent blood clotting, allowing the snake to more easily consume its prey.

        Polio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis, a viral disease that affects the nervous system. The
        vaccine is available in two forms: oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). OPV contains
        live, weakened strains of the poliovirus, while IPV contains killed poliovirus. Both vaccines are effective in
        preventing polio, but OPV is easier to administer and can also provide herd immunity. The World Health
        Organization recommends the use of both vaccines to achieve global eradication of polio. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">List different types of Polio vaccine. Write merits and demerits of polio vaccine.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        There are two types of polio vaccines:
        <br>- Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): This vaccine contains killed poliovirus and is given as an injection. The
        vaccine produces an immune response in the body without causing the disease. IPV has several merits such as
        providing long-lasting immunity, not causing vaccine-associated paralysis, and being safe for immunocompromised
        individuals. However, it requires multiple doses for full protection and is more expensive than the oral
        vaccine.
        <br>- Oral polio vaccine (OPV): This vaccine contains weakened live poliovirus and is given as drops in the
        mouth.
        The vaccine also produces an immune response without causing the disease. OPV is easy to administer, provides
        immunity to both the vaccinated individual and those who come in contact with the vaccinated individual, and is
        cheaper than the IPV. However, in rare cases, the weakened virus in the vaccine can mutate and cause
        vaccine-associated paralysis. This risk is higher in areas with low vaccination coverage.

        The clinical material used for the recovery of poliovirus is stool samples from infected individuals. The virus
        can be isolated and grown in a laboratory using cell cultures.

        Polio immunization can be done using either the IPV or the OPV. The IPV is given as an injection in the arm or
        leg, while the OPV is given as drops in the mouth. Both vaccines produce an immune response without causing the
        disease. The immunization schedule for polio vaccines depends on the type of vaccine being used and the age of
        the
        individual. In general, multiple doses are required for full protection, and booster doses may be needed to

      <p class="qa-answer">
        Polio virus is a highly infectious virus that mainly affects children under the age of 5. The virus is spread
        through contaminated food and water, and it attacks the nervous system, causing paralysis. The virus has three
        serotypes, and infection with one serotype does not provide immunity to the other serotypes. In severe cases,
        polio can cause permanent paralysis or death.

        The development of polio vaccines has led to a significant reduction in the number of polio cases worldwide.
        However, the virus is still present in a few countries, and vaccination efforts must continue to ensure the

      <h2 class="qa-question">Describe morphology of Polio virus and state how it is transmitted.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Poliovirus is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family
        Picornaviridae. It has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of approximately 30 nanometers. The capsid is made
        up
        of four proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, which are responsible for protecting the viral genome and facilitating
        viral entry into host cells. Poliovirus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, which means that the virus
        is
        present in the feces of infected individuals and can be transmitted to others through contaminated food, water,

    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Discuss pathogenesis of poliovirus.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth and nose and replicates in the gastrointestinal
        tract. The virus then spreads to the lymphoid tissue, where it can cause a mild infection or enter the
        bloodstream
        and cause viremia. In approximately 1% of cases, the virus can invade the central nervous system, causing
        inflammation and damage to motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This can result in muscle weakness,
        paralysis, and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. The pathogenesis of poliovirus is not completely
        understood,
        but it is thought to involve both direct viral damage to motor neurons and an immune-mediated response to the
        virus.</p>

        administer and can be given to large numbers of people in areas with limited access to healthcare. However, in
        rare cases, the live virus in OPV can mutate and cause vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP). For this

        Rhabdoviridae.
        The virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. It infects the central
        nervous system and can cause inflammation of the brain, leading to symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle
        weakness, and convulsions. Rabies is a serious and often fatal disease if not treated promptly.

        ii. Rabies vaccine: The rabies vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rabies. It contains inactivated rabies virus
        that stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. The vaccine is usually given
        in
        a series of injections, either before or after exposure to the virus. Pre-exposure vaccination is recommended
        for
        people who are at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, and travelers to
        countries where rabies is common. Post-exposure vaccination is recommended for people who have been bitten or

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">2. Describe the pathogenesis of rabies.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        The pathogenesis of rabies involves the replication of the virus in the peripheral nervous system and its
        subsequent spread to the central nervous system (CNS). After being transmitted through the saliva of an infected
        animal, the virus enters the body through a bite or scratch and travels along the peripheral nerves to the
        spinal
        cord and brain.

        Once in the CNS, the virus replicates rapidly, causing inflammation and damage to the brain and other parts of
        the
        CNS. The virus also travels back along the nerves to the salivary glands, where it can be transmitted to other
        animals through biting.

        The symptoms of rabies usually appear within a few weeks to a few months after exposure, although the incubation
        period can be as short as a few days or as long as several years. The early symptoms of rabies include fever,
        headache, and weakness or discomfort at the site of the bite. As the disease progresses, symptoms such as
        anxiety,
        confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and paralysis may occur. Without prompt treatment, rabies is usually
        fatal.
