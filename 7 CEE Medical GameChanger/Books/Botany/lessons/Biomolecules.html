      <h4>Metabolism of Carbohydrates</h4>
      <h5>Glycolysis</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Definition:</b> Glycolysis is the process in which glucose is converted
          to pyruvate (aerobic condition) or lactate (anaerobic
          condition), along with production of a small quantity of
          energy.</li>
        <li><b>Site: </b> Glycolysis occurs in Cytoplasm. </li>

      <h2>Protein</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Proteins are easily characterized by the following colour reactions:</p>
      <h3>Denaturation of Proteins:</h3>

      <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>Denaturation of proteins refers to the process in which a protein's secondary, tertiary, and sometimes quaternary structures are disrupted, resulting in the loss of its biological activity. </p>
        
      <h4>Causes:</h4>

        <p>  This can be caused by various factors, such as </p>
          <ol>
            <li>heat</li>
            <li>pH extremes</li>
            <li>chemicals</li>
            <li>  mechanical agitation</li>   
          </ol>
      <h4>Properties:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Structural Changes:</strong> Denaturation leads to the disruption of the protein's native three-dimensional structure, causing it to unfold.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Function:</strong> Denatured proteins often lose their biological function, as their active sites and binding regions become distorted.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> In some cases, denaturation can be reversible if the disrupting factor is removed. However, in many cases, the damage is permanent.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Types:</strong> Different proteins respond differently to denaturation; some proteins are more resistant to denaturation than others.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Examples:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooking Eggs:</strong> When you cook an egg, the heat causes the proteins in the egg white to denature. The clear egg white transforms from a liquid to a solid as the proteins unfold and bond together.</li>
        <li><strong>Curdling of Milk:</strong> The process of making cheese involves denaturing milk proteins using acid or enzymes. The denatured proteins then aggregate and form curds.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat-Shocked Proteins:</strong> Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are produced by cells in response to stressors like high temperatures. HSPs assist in refolding denatured proteins to their functional states.</li>
        <li><strong>Denaturation in Digestion:</strong> In the stomach, proteins denature due to the low pH caused by stomach acid. This denaturation exposes peptide bonds, making proteins more susceptible to enzymatic digestion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Classification of Proteins</h3>
      <h4>Based on Complexity</h4>
    <h5> Simple proteins:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Simple proteins are those which yield only α-amino acids on hydrolysis.</li>
        <li> Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>albumins</li>
            <li>albuminoids</li>
            <li>globulins</li>
            <li>glutelins</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
    <h5>Conjugated proteins:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Conjugated proteins on hydrolysis yield α-amino acids and other non-proteinous substances in addition to α-amino acids.</li>
        <li>Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>nucleoproteins</li>
            <li>glycoproteins</li>
            <li>phosphoproteins</li>
            <li>hemoglobins</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
    <h5> Derived proteins:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> These are the products formed by the action of physical, chemical, or enzymatic agents on natural proteins.</li>
        <li> Derived proteins are thus intermediate hydrolysis products of proteins.</li>
        <li> Examples:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>peptides</li>
            <li>proteoses</li>
            <li>peptones</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>

      </ul>
      
      <h4>Molisch's Test:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Originally for carbohydrate detection, can also indicate glycoprotein presence.</li>
          <li>Treatment with α-naphthol and sulfuric acid leads to a violet ring at liquid junction.</li>
          <li>Violet ring formation suggests the presence of carbohydrates and potentially glycoproteins.</li>
      </ul>
