      <h1>Transpiration</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Transpiration is the loss of water vapor (i.e., in pure form) from the aerial parts of plants.</li>
    <li>Transpiration occurs when the outer atmosphere has less moisture than substomatal cavities.</li>
    <li>The conditions under which transpiration would be most rapid are low humidity, high temperature, guard cell turgid (open), moist soil.</li>
    <li>Transpiration increases in hot, dry, and windy conditions.</li>
    <li>Transpiration is reduced due to the deposition of cutin.</li>
    <li>Rate of transpiration is reduced when there is a decrease in light intensity.</li>
    <li>Loss of water occurs in pure form (i.e., water not mixed with minerals).</li>
    <li>Transpiration is necessary for the plant for absorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and minerals, ascent of sap, and maintaining body temperature (cooling effect).</li>
    <li>Transpiration is a "Controlled phenomenon".</li>
    <li>Transpiration doesn't occur from roots.</li>
    <li>"Transpiration is a necessary evil" by Curtis.</li>
    <li>In herbaceous plants, 99% of total water absorbed by plants is lost through transpiration. So, only 1-2% is actually used by them. [IOM 2000]</li>
    <li>Transpiration mostly occurs through 3 sites:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Stomata:
          <ol>
            <li>Maximum (90% of total transpiration).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Cuticle:
          <ol>
            <li>About 9% of total transpiration.</li>
            <li>Transpiration through the general body surface.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Lenticel:
          <ol>
            <li>Very less, about 1%.</li>
            <li>Present in the bark of woody trees.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Transpiration rate of a dorsiventral leaf is higher on the lower surface due to a higher number of stomata. [BPKIHS]</li>
    <li>Transpiration from the 2 leaf surfaces is compared by dry paper strips previously soaked in a solution of cobalt chloride. i.e., cobalt chloride test is done to observe unequal transpiration in a dorsiventral leaf.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Change in the color of cobalt chloride paper from blue to pink [Hydrated - pink; dry - blue] indicates that water vapor evaporated from both the surfaces of the leaf. But the quick change in the color of CoCl<sub>2</sub> paper at the lower surface indicates a higher rate of transpiration from the lower than that of the upper surface.</li>
        <li>Dry CoCl<sub>2</sub>→Blue</li>
        <li>Moist CoCl<sub>2</sub>→Pink</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Bell jar experiment shows the loss of water vapor from the aerial parts of a plant by transpiration.</li>
    <li>Rate of transpiration is measured by Ganong's potometer.</li>
    <li>The opening and closing of the stomatal pore regulate the process of stomatal transpiration which is due to the change in turgor pressure of the guard cells.</li>
    <li>Transpiration through leaves: Foliar transpiration.<br>Transpiration through the corky covering of the stem: Bark transpiration.</li>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Only 1-2% of absorbed water is used by plants. Transpiration helps in the removal of excess water.</li>
        <li>Transpiration maintains the temperature of the plant body.</li>
        <li>Transpiration creates a suction force on the leaf surface which aids in the ascent of sap.</li>
        <li>The ash and sugar content of the fruit increases with an increase in transpiration.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Disadvantages of Transpiration
      <ol type="a">
        <li>High transpiration rates cause wilting of plants.</li>
        <li>Transpiration reduction leads to decreased photosynthesis and halted growth.</li>

  <h1>Guttation</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Due to root pressure.</li>
    <li>Guttation is the loss of water (in the form of liquid droplets) from the margin and tip (but mainly the margin) of leaves.</li>
    <li>The lost water drop is impure as it may contain dissolved minerals.</li>
    <li>In guttation, plants can get rid of excess water.</li>
    <li>Guttation occurs through hydathodes (water stomata).</li>
    <li>Hydathodes are found in the margin and tip of the leaves (but mainly the margin).
      <ul>
        <li>Loosely arranged mass of parenchyma in hydathode is called Epithem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: Hydathodes remain always open.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Guttation occurs during early morning or night when the rate of transpiration is low and absorption is high. This ultimately increases root pressure. So, guttation is not due to the activity of hydathodes but due to root pressure.</li>
    <li>Water drops present on leaf margins of Tropaeolum, Balsam, and Grasses in the early morning are due to Guttation.</li>
    <li>Occurs in a moist environment in mesophytic herbs like tomato, balsam, cucurbita, Colocassia, etc.</li>
    <li>Guttation is an uncontrolled phenomenon.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Exudation/ Bleeding</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Exudation is the loss of water sap from an incision of plant body parts.</li>
    <li>Exudation of water from leaf incision: Bleeding</li>
    <li>Exudation of water from leaf margin: Guttation</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Wilting</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Loosening of the plant part.</li>
    <li>Wilting occurs when transpiration > Water absorption, due to loss of turgidity.</li>
    <li>It occurs when xylem is blocked or xylem is removed.</li>
    <li>Percentage of water left in the soil when the plant wilts is known as the permanent wilting coefficient (PWC)/ Permanent wilting percentage (PWP).</li>
    <li>During wilting, the sequence of events shall be:
      <ul>
        <li>Exosmosis</li>
        <li>Plasmolysis</li>
        <li>Temporary wilting</li>
        <li>Permanent wilting</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Three types of wilting:
      <ul>
        <li>Incipient wilting:
          <ul>
            <li>Not visible due to partial loss of turgidity.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Temporary wilting:
          <ul>
            <li>It happens during hot days when the rate of transpiration is high and the rate of absorption is less, and is recovered at night.</li>
            <li>It is a reversible process.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Permanent wilting:
          <ul>
            <li>Plants fail to recover/return to the original state.</li>
            <li>Xylem vessels are blocked.</li>
            <li>It is an irreversible process.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Note: During wilting, there is wrinkling of the cell wall because during wilting there is only loss of water with no replacement.</li>

                  <p>Proposed by Lloyd and elaborated by Sayre and Steward.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Accordingly, stomatal opening and closing mainly depend on the activity of enzyme Starch phosphorylase in different pH.</p>

                  <p>Starch (Stomata close)  (⇄┴(pH High)┬(pH low) Sugar (Stomata open)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Conversion of starch to organic acids is required for stomatal opening.</p>
