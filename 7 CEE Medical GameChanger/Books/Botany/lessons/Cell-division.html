      <h1>Cell Cycle and Division</h1>
  
      <h2>Reason for Cell Cycle/Cell Division</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A cell divides in order to maintain balance between the bulk of cytoplasm and nucleus.</li>
        <li>The ratio of nucleus to the volume of the cytoplasm is called the Nucleocytoplasmic ratio.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Nucleocytoplasmic ratio</th>
          <th>Equation</th>
          <th>Explanation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Nucleocytoplasmic ratio</td>
          <td>\( \frac{V_n}{V_{cyto}} = \frac{V_N}{V_{cell} - V_N} \)</td>
          <td>In a cell going to divide, nucleocytoplasmic ratio (karyoplasmic ratio) and surface area per unit volume decreases.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The increase in nucleocytoplasmic ratio indicates increasing activity of cell division.</li>
        <li>Smaller cells are metabolically more active than larger cells due to high nucleocytoplasmic ratio.</li>
      </ul>



      <h2> Cell Cycle</h2>
  
      <h3>• Introduction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> The cell cycle is defined as the sequence of events in which the cell accumulates a large amount of nutrition and then divides into daughter cells.</li>
        <li> The process of forming daughter cells from the parent cell is called Cell division.</li>
        <li> Note: Generation time/cell cycle time is the total time taken by the parent cell to divide into daughter cells.</li>
        <li>The sequence of events that occurs between two cell divisions is called the Cell cycle.</li>
        <li> Phases of the Cell cycle</li>
        <li> Sequences of the Cell cycle:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> \( G_1 \rightarrow S \rightarrow G_2 \rightarrow M \)</li>
        <li> \( S \rightarrow G_2 \rightarrow M \rightarrow G_1 \)</li>
        <li> \( G_2 \rightarrow M \rightarrow G_1 \rightarrow S \)</li>
        <li> \( M \rightarrow G_1 \rightarrow S \rightarrow G_2 \)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>vii. Duration of the Cell cycle:</li>
        <li>A duration of 16 hours for a particular mammalian cell is distributed as follows:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Special points</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> \( G1 \) is the most variable phase in the cell cycle.</li>
        <li> \( G2 \) is the shortest in Interphase. But the shortest phase in the cell cycle is Mitotic phase (M-phase).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> The events that occur in the cell cycle are:</li>
        <li>Replication of DNA</li>
        <li> Nuclear division (Karyokinesis)</li>
        <li> Cytoplasmic division (Cytokinesis)</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>



<h2>1) Karyokinesis (Nuclear division)</h2>
<p><strong>All the 4 stages occur continuously without any stoppage.</strong></p>
<h3>a) Prophase</h3>
<ol>
    <li>1st and longest stage of mitosis.</li>
    <li>Metabolically most active stage of cell division.</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Interphase is metabolically most active stage of Cell cycle.</li>
    <li>Chromatin changes to chromosome i.e., chromosome becomes visible.</li>
    <li>The chromosomes of prophase are called Prochromosomes.</li>
    <li>Shows Spiralisation (Plectonemic coiling)
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Paranemic coiling is found in Meiotic prophase.</li>
            <li><strong>Q. In which phase of nuclear division is plectonemic coiling found?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meiotic prophase</li>
                    <li>Mitotic prophase</li>
                    <li>Amitotic division</li>
                    <li>Crossing over</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Centromere and Chromatids are not visible.</li>
    <li>Cell becomes more viscous.</li>
    <li>Formation of spindle fibre is started during late prophase.
        <ul>
            <li>Spindle fibres are made of 97% tubulin protein and 3% RNA.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Nuclear membrane, nucleoplasm, and nucleolus disappear during late prophase.</li>
</ol>
<h3>b) Metaphase</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Chromosomes are thickest with visible centromere and visible chromatids. So, it is the best stage to study chromosomes. (Metaphase II > Metaphase I)</li>
    <li>Chromosomes are Shortest in metaphase.</li>
    <li>Chromosomes are arranged in a single line at the equator (Metakinesis). So, a single metaphasic plate/ equatorial plate is formed.</li>
    <li>Structure, size, and counting of the number of chromosomes are done at this stage.</li>
    <li>No. of chromatids in a chromosome at metaphase is 2 in mitosis and 2 in meiosis.</li>
    <li>Spindle fibre is well developed.</li>
    <li>Spindle fibre of the opposite pole is attached to the kinetochore or primary constriction (of centromere) of the chromosome.</li>
    <li>Idiogram/ Karyotype of chromosomes is prepared.</li>
</ol>
<h3>c) Anaphase/ Migratory phase</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Shortest stage, inert (less active stage of cell division).</li>
    <li>Shape of chromosome can be studied.</li>
    <li>The shape of chromosomes in anaphase are V of J or L or I shaped, based on the position of centromere.</li>
    <li>Centromere is divided so chromatids are separated.</li>
    <li>Sister chromatids move towards opposite poles.</li>
    <li>No. of chromatids in a chromosome of anaphase is One.</li>
    <li>Poleward movement occurs due to
        <ul>
            <li>Spindle fibre and</li>
            <li>Centromere</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The main kinetics for poleward is generated by centromere.
        <br><strong>Note:</strong> The number of chromosomes remains the same but the number of chromatids is reduced to half in anaphase in comparison to metaphase.</li>
    <li>Calcium ion promotes anaphase.</li>
</ol>
<h3>d) Telophase</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Also called Re-organisation phase.</li>
    <li>It is the reverse of Prophase.
        <ul>
            <li>Nuclear membrane and Nucleolus reappear.</li>
            <li>Chromosome becomes decondensed, uncoiled and reaches to opposite poles.</li>
            <li>Spindle fibres disappear, chromosome reorganizes and the cell resumes its metabolic activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It results in the formation of two daughter nuclei with the same number of chromosomes and the same amount of DNA.</li>
</ol>



<h2>2) Cytokinesis (Cytoplasm division)</h2>
<h3>a) By cell plate: (In Plant)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>During cell plate formation, spindle fibres aggregate at the equator basically Golgi body initiates the cell plate formation which later converts into Phragmoplast and Ultimately cell wall.</li>
    <li>Plane of the cell plate is determined by Microtubules.</li>
    <li>Growth of the cell plate occurs in a Centrifugal manner.</li>
</ol>
<h3>b) Furrowing (In Animal)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Plane of furrowing is determined by Microfilament.</li>
    <li>Growth of furrows occurs in a Centripetal manner.</li>
</ol>


<h1>iii. Meiosis/ Reductional Cell division</h1>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A single primary spermatocyte (2n) and a single primary oocyte (2n) will respectively produce 4 sperms and 1 egg.
        But, a single secondary spermatocyte (n) and a single secondary oocyte (n) give 2 sperms and 1 egg 🥚 respectively.</li>

            <li>Occurrence of single, double, and triple crossing over is in the order.</li>
            <li>Crossing over is favored by 3 main enzymes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Endonuclease: For breakdown (Nicking)</li>
                    <li>Unwindase: For separation</li>
                    <li>Ligase: For rejoining</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Equal exchange of segments occurs between non-sister chromatids (homologous chromatids) of homologous chromosome during crossing over.
                <br><strong>Note:</strong> Crossing over is the major source of continuous variation in sexually reproducing organisms. But the ultimate source of variation is mutation, which produces discontinuous variation.</li>
            <li>Synapsis and synaptonemal complex and bivalent become mature.</li>
            <li>Sister chromatids become visible thus bivalents exist in the form of a tetrad i.e., Tetrad formation occurs in Pachytene.</li>
            <li>Tetrad contains 2 homologous chromosomes, 4 chromatids, 2 centromeres, and 4 kinetochores.</li>
            <li>Morphological details of the chromosome are best studied.</li>
        </ul>

       <li><strong>Diplotene</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Formation of chiasmata takes place.</li>
            <li>Synaptonemal complex starts to dissolve except at a few points called Chiasmata (indication of crossing over).</li>
            <li>Profuse decondensation of lampbrush chromosomes in the female species producing yolk eggs.
                <br><strong>E.g:</strong> All vertebrates and some invertebrates.</li>
            <li>In females, ovum remains in diplotene stage from birth to puberty. So, Diplotene is longest in human female.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Diakinesis</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Chiasmata disappears due to terminalization.</li>
            <li>Movement of chiasmata occurs from centromere to telomere in a zipper-like fashion which is called terminalization.</li>
            <li>At the end of diakinesis, each chromosome has two chromatids called dyad.</li>
            <li>Formation of spindle fibers is started and nuclear membrane, nucleolus, nucleoplasm start to disappear.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Terminalisation starts during Diakinesis.
                <br>Terminalization occurs and ends during Diakinesis.</li>
            <li><strong>Synaptonemal complex (SC)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a feature of meiotic prophase I.</li>
                    <li>Ubiquitin is the characteristic protein forming SC (Synaptonemal Complex).</li>
                    <li>1st observed by Moses.</li>
                    <li>Synaptonemal complex appears in Zygotene,
                        persists in pachytene (more clear), and
                        disappears during diplotene.</li>
                    <li>It helps in the proper pairing of homologous chromosomes and in producing recombination.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Metaphase-I</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Paired chromosomes arrange themselves at the equatorial plane (congression).</li>
            <li>Chromosomes are arranged in two distinct lines (i.e., Double metaphase plate is formed).</li>
            <li>Appearance of Spindle fibers.</li>
            <li>Chromosome at Metaphase-I consists of 2 chromatids and 1 centromere.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anaphase-I</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>It is the stage of separation of maternal and paternal chromosomes of the homologous pair also called disjunction and the separated chromosomes are called univalents or dyads.</li>
            <li>Centromere is not divided.</li>
            <li>No. of chromosomes is reduced to half but no. of chromatids remains the same in anaphase-I in comparison to metaphase-I.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Cytokinesis (Cytoplasm division)</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<h3>Interkinesis:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It is a brief intrameiotic interphase, but without S-phase (DNA synthesis does not occur).
    </li>
    <li>
      Time period between meiosis-I and meiosis-II is called Interkinesis.
    </li>
  </ol>
  

<h2>2) Meiosis-II</h2>
<p><strong>Similar to that of mitosis and so called meiotic mitosis.</strong></p>
<h3>a) Karyokinesis (Nuclear division)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prophase-II</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Metaphase-II</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Anaphase-II</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Telophase-II</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>b) Cytokinesis (Cytoplasm division)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Successive type:</strong>
        <p>Both meiosis I and meiosis II are followed by wall formation and lead to the formation of isobilateral tetrads.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Simultaneous type:</strong>
        <p>Meiosis I is not followed by wall formation but wall formation occurs simultaneously after meiosis II and leads to the formation of tetrahedral tetrads.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of Meiosis</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintains the number of chromosomes constant in sexually reproducing organisms.</li>
    <li>Recombination occurs as a result of crossing over which has a role in evolution.</li>
    <li>Meiosis shows the basic relationship among organisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>No. of cytokinesis in Meiosis = 3 (1 in meiosis I and 2 in meiosis II)</li>
            <li>No. of spindles in Meiosis = 3 (1 in metaphase I and 2 in metaphase II)</li>
            <li>No. of chromatids per chromosome is 2 in metaphase of mitosis/meiosis; 1 in anaphase of mitosis and 2 in anaphase I of meiosis I.</li>
        </ul>
