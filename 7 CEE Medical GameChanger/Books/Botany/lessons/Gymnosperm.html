      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Gymnosperms are called "naked-seeded" plants because they lack an ovary.</li>
          <li>Some members of gymnosperms are known as "living fossils," which are organisms present in both living and fossil forms without significant evolutionary changes.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Examples: Cycas, Ginkgo, Metasequoia</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conduction Tissue</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Xylem is without vessels, except in the Gnetales order where vessels are present (+ve).</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Gnetum, Ephedra, Welwitschia</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Phloem lacks companion cells and instead has albuminous tissue (+ve).</li>
          <li>Sieve tube is absent, and sieve cells are present (+ve).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Leaf and Size</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Leaves are unipinnately compounded.</li>
          <li>Gymnosperms are generally large-sized and branched, with exceptions like Cycas and Zamia pygmaea (smallest gymnosperm).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Reproductive Structures and Pollination</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Male and female reproductive structures are called Male cone and Female cone, respectively, except for the Female cone of Cycas.</li>
          <li>Pollination is anemophilous (by wind).</li>
          <li>Pollination in gymnosperms involves the transfer of microspores from microsporophyll to ovule directly.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Fertilization and Endosperm</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Ovule is typically orthotropous, except in Pinus, where it's anatropous (PAN).</li>
          <li>Fertilization is Siphonogamous type, except for Cycas, which has Zooidogamous type.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Zooidogamous type involves motile male gamete movement with the help of flagella or cilia.</li>
              <li>Siphonogamous type involves non-motile male gametes and pollen tube.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Endosperm is haploid.</li>
      </ul>

          <li>Mangifera indica</li>
          <li>Pinus roxburgii</li>

<h1>Cycas Plants</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cycas is a member of Cycadopsida.</li>
    <li>Cycas revoluta is native to Nepal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Habitat and Plant Body</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The plant is found in physical xerophytic conditions, which include hot climates and tropical regions.</li>
    <li>The plant body is an unbranched tree, differentiated into:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Root</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Coralloid root is -ve geotropic (apogeotropic) and contains Nostoc and Anabaena symbiotically.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Stem</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The stem is solid, cylindrical, and unbranched, referred to as Caudex type.</li>
            <li>Leaf scars are found around the stem due to persistent leaf bases.</li>
            <li>The wood is porous and soft, commercially less important.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Leaf</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaves show xerophytic adaptations like thick cuticles and sunken stomata.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Reproductive Structures</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Male plant consists of Male cone where microspores or pollen grains are produced.</li>
    <li>Female plant doesn't contain a female cone, but megasporophylls are loosely arranged in a rosette form.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ovules and Fertilization</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ovules of Cycas are orthotropous, unitegmic, and the largest among the plant kingdom.</li>
    <li>Ovules consist of:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pollen chamber</li>
        <li>Archegonial chamber</li>
        <li>Archegonia without Neck Canal Cell (NCC)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Neck cells (Cover cells) are +ve.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Male Gametes and Pollination</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Male gametes of Cycas are top-shaped, multiflagellated, and the largest among the plant kingdom.</li>
    <li>Pollination is anemophilous type, taking place at the 3-celled stage.</li>
    <ul>

</ul>

<h2>Fertilization and Seed Development</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fertilization is zooidiogamous type, intermediate between zooidiogamy and Siphonogamy.</li>
    <li>Pollen tube is formed but does not carry the male gamete; it only works as a haustorium to absorb liquid.</li>
    <li>After fertilization, the ovule develops into two cotyledons.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Sexual Reproduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pinus is Monoecious and Autoecious.</li>
    <li>Monoecious: Male and Female cones found on separate branches of the same tree.</li>
    <li>Fertilization occurs after 11-15 months of pollination, by Siphonogamy (Non-motile gamete).</li>
    <li>Seeds are matured and ready for germination after 3 years of development.</li>
    <li>Seed germination is Epigeal type.</li>
    <li>Each seed consists of 2 to 18 cotyledons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Male Cone</h2>
<p>Male cones develop in the axils of scale leaves found in clusters.</p>

<h2>Female Cone</h2>
<p>Female cones arise in the axils of scale leaves at the tip of new strong shoots at some distance from the male cones. They grow in about 3 years.</p>
<p>Female cone is considered as a modified inflorescence due to the presence of a bract.</p>

<h2>Megasporophyll of Female Cone</h2>
<p>The megasporophyll of the female cone consists of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ovuliferous scale</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Each ovuliferous scale bears 2 naked ovules towards the basal region on the upper (adaxial) side.</li>
        <li>Ovules/Megasporangia are unitegmic and anatropous type.</li>
        <li>Megaspores are formed by meiosis in the megaspore mother cell (MMC).</li>
        <li>Functional megaspore germinates to form the female gametophyte bearing archegonia (2 to 5 in number).</li>
        <li>Archegonium consists of 4+4=8 neck cells:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Venter Canal Cell (VCC)</li>
            <li>1 Egg cell</li>
            <li>0 Neck Canal cell (NCC)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Bract scale</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pollination and Fertilization</h2>
<p>1. Pollen tube acts as a pollen carrier.</p>
<p>2. Pollen grains are winged (wings develop from exine).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Winged Pollen grain = Pinus (Develops from exine)</li>
    <li>Winged seed = Moringa</li>
    <li>Winged fruit = Hiptage & Shorea</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Pollination takes place at the 4-celled stage (2 prothallial cells, 1 generative cell, 1 tube cell).</p>
<p>4. During pollination, the atmosphere becomes yellowish, called the Shower of sulphur.</p>
<p>5. The body cell divides to form 2 passive male gametes.</p>
<p>6. The pollen tube bursts, and the two gametes are liberated. Only one of these fuses with the egg nucleus, the other degenerates.</p>

<h2>Male Gamete</h2>
<p>The male gamete is non-motile and winged.</p>
