      <h2>History</h2>
      <h2>Contributors in Cell Research</h2>

      <h3>Robert Hooke</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Term "Cell" was coined by him in 1665.</li>

        <li>Discovered cell from outer bark of Quercus suber (Cork Oak).</li>
        <li>Actually it was Cell wall, Dead cell, Attached cell.</li>
        <li>Robert Hooke published his findings in the book <em>Micrographia</em>.</li>


      </ol>

      <h3>A.V. Leeuwenhoek</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Father of Microscopy</li>
        <li>Discovered living cells and free cells.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Cell Theory and Its Aspects</h2>

      <h3>Cell Theory</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cell theory was proposed by Schwann (German Zoologist) and Schleiden (German Botanist). </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Note: 1st idea of cell theory was given by Dutrochet by boiling the leaf of Mimosa pudica in nitric acid
            and separating the cell.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>It states that all living beings consist of cells and cells are the smallest structural and functional unit
          of life.</li>
        <li>Cell theory was extended by Rudolf Virchow. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Rudolf Virchow proposed "Law of cell lineage" stated "omnis cellula e cellula," meaning all cells
            originate from pre-existing cells only by reproduction.</li>
          <li>Cell principle/Cell doctrine/Modern or modified cell theory = Cell theory + Cell lineage.</li>
        </ul>

      </ol>
      <h3>Exceptions of cell theory:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Virus = Obligate parasites, Sub-cellular in nature (Major exception)</li>
        <li>Vaucheria (Algae) = Multinucleated</li>
        <li>Rhizopus, Mucor (Fungi) = Multinucleated</li>
        <li>Paramecium (Protista) = Binucleate/multinucleated</li>
        <li>Opalina (Protist) = Multinucleated</li>
      </ul>




      <h2>Cell Size</h2>
      <h3>The Normal Cell Size</h3>
      <p>The normal cell size is 0.2 Œºm to 20 Œºm.</p>
      <h3>Unit of Measurement</h3>
      <p>The unit of measurement in micron (Œºm) in light microscope and is angstrom (√Ö) in electron microscope.</p>
      <h3>Factors Affecting Cell Size</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          \( \text{Cell size} \propto \text{Chromosome number} \)
        </li>
        <li>
          \( \text{Cell size} \propto \text{Size of Chromosome} \)
        </li>
        <li>
          \( \text{Cell size} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Metabolic activity}} \) \( (\because \text{Smaller cells are
          metabolically active}) \)
        </li>
        <li>
          \( \text{Cell size} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Nucleocytoplasmic ratio}} \) \( (\because \text{Nucleocytoplasmic
          ratio} \propto \text{Metabolic activity}) \)
        </li>
        <li>
          \( \text{Cell size} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Surface area of the cell per unit volume}} \) \( (\because
          \text{Smaller cells have greater surface area per unit volume}) \)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Smallest Cell</h3>

            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Smallest cell with cell wall = Bacteria (Dialister pneumosintes)</li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Cell Dividing Capacity</h2>
      <h3>Cellular Totipotency</h3>
      <p>Cellular totipotency (Latin: Totus = all; potens = power)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Capacity of individual or single, nucleated, living vegetative plant cell to regenerate whole plant.</li>
        <li>Idea of cellular totipotency was firstly given by Haberlandt.</li>
        <li>Phenomenon of cellular totipotency was proved experimentally by Steward and his co-worker.</li>
        <li>He used phloem tissue from roots of carrot as an explant.</li>
        <li>Used coconut milk in his experiment as liquid media. </li>
        <ol>
          <li>Coconut ü•• milk naturally contains cytokinin which induces cell division.</li>
          <li>So, cytokinin (zeatin) is also called coconut milk factor.</li>
          <li>Zeatin/ Cytokinin/ Kinetin is also rich in immature maize grain.</li>
        </ol>

      </ol>


      <h3>Pluripotency</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pluripotency is the potential ability of an animal cell to develop into any type of cell in the animal body
          but not into the whole animal.</li>
        <li>Stem cells are only totipotent in animals.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cell Ghosts</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Erythrocyte empties; named so because they are difficult to observe under a light microscope due to the
          absence of contents.</li>
        <li>Erythrocyte contents come out when a drop of blood is placed in water.</li>
        <li>It causes rupturing of erythrocytes or haemolysis.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Cell Types</h2>
      <h3>Based on Complexity</h3>
      <h4>Akaryotic Cell</h4>
      <h4>Prokaryotic Cell</h4>
      <h4>Mesokaryotic Cell</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Nucleus with nuclear membrane but lacks histone protein in DNA and nucleolus in nucleus.</li>
        <li>Cell division occurs by dinomitosis.</li>
        <li>Rest of the characters are the same as eukaryotic cell.
          <p>For example: Dinoflagellates</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Formation of Cell Wall</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cell wall is formed during cytokinesis from vesicles of ER and Golgi bodies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Layers of Cell Wall</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In higher plants, cell walls consist of different layers:</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Middle lamellae:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Outermost layer of cell wall.</li>
        <li>Layer between cell walls of two cells is Middle lamellae.</li>
        <li>Cementing layer that joins 2 adjacent plant cells together.</li>
        <li>Contains cementing material Ca-pectate and Mg-pectate (Mainly Ca-pectate).</li>
        <li>Retting of fibers and ripened fruit becomes soft due to dissolution of middle lamellae (dissolution of
          Ca-pectate) and dissolution is brought by Pectinase enzyme.</li>
        <li>Grows by Intussusceptions or Apposition.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Primary cell wall:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Elastic in nature</li>
        <li>Unipartite (Single layer)</li>
        <li>Found universally in all cells having cell wall.</li>
        <li>Lies inner to middle lamella.</li>
        <li>Made up of Cellulose (Œ≤-D glucose unit), Hemicellulose, and Pectin roughly in equal amount.</li>
        <li>Lignin is never found in the primary cell wall but may have Silica, Wax, Cutin, etc.</li>
        <li>Common in Parenchyma and Meristematic cells.</li>
        <li>Grows by Intussusception.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Secondary cell wall:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Thick</li>
        <li>Inelastic in nature</li>
        <li>Present inner to the primary cell wall.</li>
        <li>Tripartite: S1, S2 (thickest layer), and S3.</li>
        <li>Developed by Apposition.</li>
        <li>Pits are common.</li>
        <li>Provides mechanical strength, stiffness, and hardness to the cell.</li>
        <li>Made up of Cellulose (high), sometimes hemicellulose, and additional components like Cutin, Suberin, Pectin,
          Lignin, Wax, Silica, Mucilage, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4> Tertiary cell wall:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes S3 of secondary wall is called tertiary wall when it contains Xylon (Polymer of D-xylose) and
          Mannon.</li>
        <li>Thick and warty in appearance.</li>
        <li>Found in Tracheids of gymnosperms.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Cell Coat (Glycocalyx)</h2>
  
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In animal cells, the cell wall is absent, and the outermost covering is called Cell coat üß• or Glycocalyx.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Composition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cell coat is made up of Oligosaccharides, and the terminal sugar of the oligosaccharide is Sialic acid.</li>
        <li>The layer of carbohydrate oligosaccharide in animal cells helps in cell-to-cell recognition.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Glycocalyx Composition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Glycocalyx = Glycoprotein + Glycolipid.</li>

        <li>Glycocalyx is a site of Cell recognition.</li>
        <li>Glycocalyx makes the cell membrane asymmetric.</li>
      </ul>
