      <h1>TISSUE SYSTEM</h1>

      <h2>Epidermal Tissue System</h2>

      <li>Forms outer covering of plants</li>

      <li>It includes:</li>

      <h3>Epidermis:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Epi means upon + derma means skin and hence it is a continuous outer layer interrupted by Stomata and
          Lenticels.</li>
        <li>Generally single layered but
          multilayered epidermis is found in:
          <ol>
            <li>Phylloclades of Casuarina,</li>
            <li>Leaves of Nerium and Ficus as well as</li>
            <li>Hygroscopic roots of epiphytes</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Velamen tissue found on the surface of hygroscopic root is multiple epidermis whose cells are dead.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Layer of cuticle is found on the epidermis of stem and leaves but absent in root.</li>
        <li> Cuticle layer acts as protection to epidermis and checks excessive transpiration.</li>
        <li>Epidermal cells are living and generally don't possess chloroplast except shade plants (Sciophytes),
          hydrophytes and some ferns, etc.</li>
        <li> Further chloroplasts are present in guard cells (Specialized epidermal cells).</li>
        <li>Note: Guard cells (living cell) even having chloroplast is heteromorphic due to the absence of RUBISCO.</li>
        <li>Bulliform cells or Motor cells or Bubble-like cells are found in upper epidermis of isobilateral leaves
          (monocot).</li>
        <li> It helps in rolling and unrolling of leaves (mainly rolling).</li>
        <li>Outermost layer of root is known as Epiblema or Piliferous layer or Rhizodermis which is not cutinised or
          suberised and also doesn't contain stomata.</li>
        <li>Stomata and lenticels are confined to Epidermis.</li>
        <li>In grasses and Equisetum, silica is present in the epidermal cells.</li>
        <li>Epidermal cells containing cystoliths (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) are called lithocysts.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Stomata:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Minute pores occur on epidermal surface of leaves and also some herbaceous stem.</li>
        <li>Each stoma/pore is guarded by 2 specialized kidney-shaped or bean-shaped epidermal cells, called Guard
          cells.</li>
        <li>Guard cells are also guarded by specialized epidermal cells called subsidiary cells/ accessory cells.</li>
        <li>In some monocots like doob grass (Cynodon dactylon) and maize, guard cells are dumb-bell or barbell-shaped.
        </li>
        <li>In dicot, guard cells are kidney-shaped.</li>
        <li>In dicot leaves, stomata are scattered whereas in monocots these are scattered in rows.</li>
        <li>In dicots, stomata are generally present on lower epidermis whereas in monocots on both surfaces.</li>
        <li>In free-floating hydrophytes (e.g. Lotus, Nymphea), stomata are present on upper epidermis, whereas in
          submerged hydrophytes, these are absent or non-functional.</li>
        <li>In algae and fungi, stomata are totally absent.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Trichome/ Hairs:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unicellular → in Roots</li>
        <li>Multicellular → in Stems</li>
        <li>Trichomes help in checking excess loss of water and secondly provide protection.</li>
      </ol>

      </ol>


      <h2> Ground Tissue System</h2>

      <p>Between epidermis and vascular tissue.</p>
      <p>It comprises:</p>


      <h3> Hypodermis</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Outermost layer of Cortex.</li>
        <li>Collenchymatous in herbaceous dicot stem.</li>
        <li>Sclerenchymatous in monocot stem.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Cortex</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Present inside hypodermis.</li>
        <li>Usually parenchymatous with abundant intercellular space.</li>
        <li>Innermost layer of cortex is called as Endodermis.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Endodermis/ Starch Sheath:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Endodermis is single layered which separates cortex from stele.</li>
        <li>Part of extrastelar ground tissue system.</li>
        <li>Cells of endodermis are:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Barrel-shaped,</li>
          <li>Without inter-cellular spaces,</li>
          <li>Living, and</li>
          <li>Containing starch, hence known as starch sheath.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Radial and tangential walls of endodermal cells possess thickenings of lignin, suberin, and cutin in the
          form of casparian stripes or Casparian bands.</li>
        <li>Passage cells are present just against protoxylem in root. Casparian stripes and passage cells are found in
          exodermis also.</li>
        <li>A well-developed endodermis is a constant feature of roots (not in stem).</li>
      </ol>


      <h3> Pericycle</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Single or Few layered.</li>
        <li>In Smilax root (monocot), pericycle is multilayered and sclerenchymatous.</li>
        <li>In some cases like Sunflower stem, pericycle is heterogeneous i.e., composed of both thick-walled and
          thin-walled cells.</li>
        <li>Thin-walled parenchymatous or rarely thick-walled sclerenchymatous cells inside the endodermis.</li>
        <li>Present in most roots except in roots of parasitic plants and hydrophytes.</li>
        <li>Thick-walled pericycle is mechanical in function whereas thin-walled pericycle is storage in function.</li>
        <li>In dicot root, pericycle can also form Cambium.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3> Medulla (Pith) and Medullary Rays (Pith Rays)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The core of plant axis is occupied by a mass of parenchymatous tissue called Medulla or Pith.</li>
        <li>Medulla radiated out and present between vascular bundle is called Medullary rays or Pith rays.</li>
        <li>Medulla helps in storage of food while medullary rays help in lateral transportation.</li>
        <li>Pith is distinct in Dicot stem and Monocot root, scattered in Monocot stem but indistinct in Dicot root.
        </li>
        <li>In some monocots, the central region of the stem is hollow and is called Pith cavity.</li>
        <li>Pith is developed in Dicot stem and Monocot root.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Conjunctive Tissue</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Parenchymatous tissue present between Xylem and Phloem bundles.</li>
      </ol>



      <p>Part of ground tissue present outside endodermis is called Cortex and inside endodermis is called Stele.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stele includes all tissue inside the endodermis.</li>
        <li>Stele in monocot is atactostele and in dicot is eustele.</li>
        <li>Endodermis is absent in monocot stem. Thus, ground tissue of monocot stem is not differentiated into cortex
          and stele.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>III. Vascular Tissue System</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Central column of axis (root and stem) is called 'Stele' which is made of a number of vascular bundles,
          constituting vascular tissue system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stelar region includes all tissues inside pericycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          The vascular bundle has Xylem, Phloem, and Cambium (if present).
          <ol>
            <li>Note: Cambium is a stripe of Primary meristem.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Vascular bundle is mainly 3 types.

      <h3> Radial:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Xylem and Phloem occur in separate bundles, present in different radii, alternate to each other and equal in
          number.</li>
        <li>E.g: Roots (Dicot and Monocot both).</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Conjoint:</h3>

      <li>Xylem and Phloem in the same bundle and in the same radius. E.g: Stem</li>
      <li>2 types:</li>

      <h4> Collateral:</h4>
    
        <p>Phloem lies towards the outer side or pericycle and xylem towards the center or pith.</p>
        <h5>Open:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Xylem and Phloem separated by Cambium layer.</li>
          <li>Cambium is absent.</li>
          <li>E.g: Dicot stem</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Closed:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Xylem and Phloem separated by Cambium layer.</li>
          <li>Cambium is absent.</li>
          <li>E.g: Monocot stem</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Bicollateral:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Phloem is present on both sides of xylem.</li>
          <li>The bundle is always Open.</li>
          <li>Arrangement of Vascular tissue = Phloem → Cambium → Xylem → Cambium → Phloem</li>
          <li>Examples:</li>
          <p>Stem of members of:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Cucurbitaceae</li>
            <li> Solanaceae</li>
            <li> Convulvulaceae family</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Q. Bicollateral vascular bundles are found in the stem of:</li>
          <ol>
            <li> Cycas/ Sunflower</li>
            <li> Gram/ Canna</li>
            <li> Pumpkin</li>
            <li> Dracaena</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

        <h3> Concentric:</h3>

        <li>Xylem and Phloem are found in a definite circle.</li>
        <li>Always closed.</li>
        <li>Concentric vascular bundles are characteristics of pteridophytes and a few monocots.</li>
        <li>2 types:</li>

        <h4>Amphicribal/ (Hadro) - Xylem centric:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Xylem centrally located and surrounded by Phloem.</li>
          <li>E.g: Found in underground stem of some monocots like:</li>
          <ol>
            <li> Ferns</li>
            <li> Some aquatic angiosperms</li>
            <li>Lycopodium</li>
            <li> Selaginella</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <h4>Amphivasal/ (Lepto) - Phloem centric:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Xylem surrounds centrally situated Phloem.</li>
          <li>E.g: Found in underground stem of some monocots like:</li>
          <ol>
            <li> Dagger plant (Yucca)</li>
            <li> Dragon plant (Dracaena)</li>
            <li> Sweet flag (Acorus)</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

        <h1> Root-stem transition:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Conversion of radial and exarch vascular bundle into conjoint and endarch vascular bundles is called as Root-stem transition.</li>
            <li> Swinging of xylem occurs during this transition and Phloem remains stationary.</li>
            <li> Root-stem transition zone is present in Hypocotyl.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1>Origin of Lateral roots and Lateral branches of Stem:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Origin of lateral root is endogenous and is originated from pericycle.</li>
            <li> Seat of origin of lateral root is situated just against Protoxylem.</li>
            <li>Origin of lateral branches of stem is Exogenous.</li>
            <li>Lateral branches are originated from outer part of Cortex.</li>
        </ol>

  <h1>Secondary Growth in Dicot Stem</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Cells of medullary rays become meristematic and form interfascicular cambium to join intrafascicular cambium to form a complete ring called Cambium ring.
    </li>
    <li>
      The cambium ring consists of 2 types of cells, the fusiform initials and the ray initials.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          Fusiform initials form secondary phloem on the exterior and secondary xylem on the interior side.
          <ul>
            <li>That present in secondary xylem is known as Wood or Xylem ray.</li>
            <li>That present in secondary phloem is called Phloem ray.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Ray initials form parenchymatous medullary rays.
    </li>
    <li>
      In spring (favourable season), cambium produces conducting elements of wider diameter called Spring or Early wood.
    </li>
    <li>
      In winter, it produces elements of narrow diameter known as Autumn or Late wood.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each year's growth is distinct due to sudden stem appear as concentric rings known as Growth rings/ Annual rings and represent total wood formed in a year.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          Each year's growth is distinct due to the sudden transition from autumn wood to spring wood of the next year. The transition from spring to autumn wood is gradual.
        </li>
        <li>
          Annual rings are used to study the climate of that area known as Dendroclimatology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Annual rings are formed due to unequal activity of cambium in autumn and spring seasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Annual rings are absent in plants growing in places having uniform climate.
        </li>
        <li>
          The age determination of trees by counting the annual growth rings is known as Dendrochronology.
