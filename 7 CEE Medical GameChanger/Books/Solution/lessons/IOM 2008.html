    <div class="solution">(d) In the reaction Cr2O7^(2−)→2Cr^(3+), each Cr atom undergoes a change from a oxidation state of +6 to +3, which means that each Cr atom gains three electrons. Since there are two Cr atoms in the reactant and product, the total number of electrons transferred is 6 × 3 = 18. Each Cr atom gains 3 electrons,
        thus the total transfer of electrons is 2 × 3 = 6 electrons. Therefore, the correct option is (d) Cr2O7^(2−)→2Cr^(3+), where there is a transfer of five electrons.

    <div class="solution">(a) The volume of H2 produced can be calculated using the formula: Volume = (Weight of H2 / Atomic weight of H2) * 22.4 L. Given that 1 coulomb of electricity produces 10-5 gm of H2, and the current is 0.25 Amp for 2 hours (7200 seconds), the weight of H2 produced is (0.25 Amp * 7200 seconds) * 10-5 gm = 0.18 gm. The atomic weight of H2 is 2, so the volume of H2 produced at NTP is (0.18 gm / 2) * 22.4 L = 0.108 litre.</div>

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(b) The formula of the oxide 'X' can be determined by comparing the weights of X and oxygen in the given sample. The weight of X is 2.54 g, and the total weight of the sample is 3.34 g. Therefore, the weight of oxygen in the sample is 3.34 g - 2.54 g = 0.8 g. Since 
        Since the atomic weight of X is 127 and the weight of oxygen is 0.8 g, we can calculate the moles of X and oxygen in the sample.
        
        Moles of X = Weight of X / Atomic weight of X = 2.54 g / 127 g/mol = 0.02 mol
        Moles of oxygen = Weight of oxygen / Atomic weight of oxygen = 0.8 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol
        
        To determine the empirical formula, we divide the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles. In this case, the smallest number of moles is 0.02 mol.
        
        Moles of X / 0.02 mol = 1
        Moles of oxygen / 0.02 mol = 2.5
        
        Rounding off, we get approximately 1 mole of X and 2.5 moles of oxygen.
        
        The empirical formula of the oxide 'X' is therefore X2O4, option (b).

    <div class="solution">(c) The volume occupied by one molecule of water can be calculated using Avogadro's number and the molar volume. Avogadro's number is approximately 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules per mole. Since the density of water is 1 gm/cc, the molar volume of water is 18 cc/mol (molar mass of water is approximately 18 g/mol). Therefore, the volume occupied by one molecule of water is (18 cc/mol) / (6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules/mol) = 2.98 x 10<sup>-23</sup> cc.</div>

    <div class="solution">(a) The angle of deviation of the emergent ray from the direction of the incident ray is given by the formula: δ = (α + β) - A, where A is the sum of the angles made by the emergent ray with the normal at the two surfaces. Since the paperweight is spherical, A = 0, so δ = α - β.</div>

    <div class="solution">(d) Chromatic aberration is caused by the fact that the focal length of a lens varies with the wavelength of light. This means that light of different colors (wavelengths) is focused at different points, resulting in a blurred image with colored fringes around the edges.</div>
