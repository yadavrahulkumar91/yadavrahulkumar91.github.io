      <div class="choice">
                0n1 + 2He4
      </div>
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="solution">The correct answer is <b>a. 1H1 and 0n1</b>. In the first nuclear reaction, 7N14 + 2He4 = 8O17 +X, the mass number of the reactants is 14 + 4 = 18. The mass number of the products is 17 + 1 = 18. Therefore, the mass number of X is 1. The atomic number of the reactants is 7 + 2 = 9. The atomic number of the products is 8 + 1 = 9. Therefore, the atomic number of X is 1. The only particle with mass number 1 and atomic number 1 is the proton, 1H1.

    In the second nuclear reaction, 13Al27 + 1H2 = 14Si28 +Y, the mass number of the reactants is 27 + 2 = 29. The mass number of the products is 28 + 1 = 29. Therefore, the mass number of Y is 1. The atomic number of the reactants is 13 + 1 = 14. The atomic number of the products is 14 + 0 = 14. Therefore, the atomic number of Y is 0. The only particle with mass number 1 and atomic number 0 is the neutron, 0n1.</div>

                 RCH_2 NO_2
      </div>
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="solution">The correct answer is <b>a. (CH_3 )_2 NH</b>. Tautomerism is a chemical phenomenon in which a molecule exists in two or more different structural forms (tautomers) that are interconverted by rapid, reversible chemical reactions. The most common type of tautomerism is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the interconversion of a keto form and an enol form. In the case of (CH_3 )_2 NH, the two tautomeric forms are the keto form and the enol form.

    The keto form is the more stable form, but the enol form is also present in equilibrium. The enol form is more reactive than the keto form, and it can be used in a variety of chemical reactions.</div>

        </div>
      
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">The correct answer is <b>c. 4.0</b>. The equilibrium constant, K, for a reaction is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of the products to the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants. In this reaction, the equilibrium constant can be expressed as follows: <br>
        K = [CH3COOC2H5]^2 / [CH3COOH]^2 [C2H5OH]^2 <br>
        Initially, the concentrations of the reactants are equal, so [CH3COOH] = [C2H5OH] = 1. When equilibrium is attained, 2/3 of the acid and alcohol are consumed, so the concentrations of the products are: <br>
        [CH3COOC2H5] = 2/3
        [CH3COOH] = 1/3
        [C2H5OH] = 1/3
        Substituting these values into the equilibrium constant expression gives: <br>
        K = (2/3)^2 / (1/3)^2 (1/3)^2 = 4
        Therefore, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is 4.</div>

    <div class="solution">The correct answer is <b>b. Oxalic acid and ethylene glycol</b>. Baeyer's reagent is a solution of potassium permanganate in water. It is a strong oxidizing agent and can be used to oxidize alkenes and alkynes. When ethylene and acetylene are reacted with Baeyer's reagent, they are oxidized to oxalic acid and ethylene glycol, respectively.

        The reactions are as follows: <br>
        C2H4 + 2KMnO4 + 4H2O → 2H2C2O4 + 2KOH + MnO2 <br>
        C2H2 + 4KMnO4 + 4H2O → 2H2C2O4 + 4KOH + 2MnO2 <br>
