    <div class="solution">(c) The normality of the solution can be calculated using the formula: Normality (N) = (Weight of solute in grams / Equivalent weight of solute) / Volume of solution in liters. 
        Given:
        Weight of Na₂CO₃ = 6.36 grams
        Volume of solution = 0.6 liters
        Equivalent weight of Na₂CO₃ = 52.995 g (as calculated earlier)
        
        To find the normality, we can use the formula: Normality (N) = (Weight of solute in grams / Equivalent weight of solute) / Volume of solution in liters.
        
        Substituting the values:
        Normality (N) = (6.36 g / 52.995 g) / 0.6 L
        
        Calculating:
        Normality (N) = 0.01 N
        
        Therefore, the normality of the solution containing 6.36 grams of Na₂CO₃ in 600 ml of it is 0.01 N.

    Next, we need to convert the volume of the solution to liters: 
    250 mL x (1 L / 1000 mL) = 0.25 L
    Finally, we can calculate the molarity:

    <div class="solution">(c) A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. It works by lowering the activation energy of the reaction, which is the amount of energy required to start the reaction. By lowering the activation energy, a catalyst allows more molecules to have the required energy to react, thus increasing the rate of the reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is that a catalyst lowers the activation energy.</div>

    <div class="solution">The maximum horizontal distance achieved by the ball is known as the range of the projectile, which is given by the equation R = (v^2 * sin(2θ)) / g, where v is the initial velocity of the ball, θ is the angle of projection, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The maximum height achieved by the ball is given by the equation H = (v^2 * sin^2(θ)) / 2g. Given that the ball can be thrown to a maximum horizontal distance of 100 m, we can assume that the angle of projection is 45 degrees (which gives the maximum range for a given initial velocity). Substituting the values in the equation for maximum height, we get H = (v^2 / 2g). Since the initial velocity and acceleration due to gravity are constants, the maximum height achieved by the ball is directly proportional to the square of the initial velocity. Therefore, if the ball can be thrown to a maximum horizontal distance of 100 m, it can be thrown to a maximum height of (100^2 / 2*9.8) = 510.2 m (approximately).</div>

    <div class="solution">(c) 2.5 m/s² is the minimum acceleration of the body. The net force acting on the body is the vector sum of the two forces. The minimum acceleration occurs when the two forces are in the same direction, so the net force is their sum, which is 6N + 2N = 8N. Using Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the net force and m is the mass of the body, we can solve for a: 8N = 2kg * a, a = 8N / 2kg = 4 m/s². Since the acceleration cannot be less than 4 m/s², option (c) is correct.</div>

    <div class="solution">(b) Root mean square velocity is constant. According to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Assuming the number of moles and volume are constant, the product of pressure and temperature is constant. Since the temperature is the same for both gases, their product of pressure and volume must be the same. The root mean square velocity of a gas is given by the equation v = sqrt(3RT/M), where v is the root mean square velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass of the gas. Since the pressure and 
        Since the pressure and volume are constant and the product of pressure and volume is the same for both gases, according to the ideal gas law, the quantity (P * V) / T is constant.
        
        Now, let's consider the quantities mentioned in the choices:
        
        a) Total number of molecules: The number of molecules, represented by 'n' in the ideal gas law, is not necessarily constant. It can vary depending on the amount of gas present.
        
        b) Root mean square velocity: The root mean square velocity of a gas, represented by 'v' in the equation v = sqrt(3RT/M), depends on the temperature (T) and the molar mass (M) of the gas. Since the temperature is constant and the molar mass is specific to each gas, the root mean square velocity can vary between gases.
        
        c) Average kinetic energy: The average kinetic energy of gas molecules, represented by 'K.E. avg' in the equation K.E. avg = (3/2)kT, depends on the temperature (T) and the Boltzmann constant (k). Since the temperature is constant and the Boltzmann constant is a universal constant, the average kinetic energy remains constant for both gases.
        
        Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Average kinetic energy, which is constant when the temperature, pressure, and volume of two gases are the same.

    <div class="solution">(b) The particle will move in a circular orbit with its speed increasing.

        Volume of boat = 3m x 2m x h = 6h cubic meters
        When the man stands on the boat, the boat sinks by 1 cm, which is equal to 0.01 m. Let the weight of the man be 'w'.
        The weight of the man is equal to the buoyant force exerted by the water on the boat and the man.
        Buoyant force = Weight of water displaced = Volume of water displaced x Density of water x Acceleration due to gravity
        Buoyant force = 6h x 1000 kg/m^3 x 9.8 m/s^2 = 58.8h Newtons
        Weight of the man = w = 58.8h Newtons
        Now, the boat sinks by 1 cm when the man stands on it. Therefore,
        Volume of water displaced by the boat and the man = Volume of boat + Volume of man
        (3m x 2m x 0.01m) = (3m x 2m x h) + Volume of man
        0.06 = 6h + Volume of man
        Volume of man = 0.06 - 6h
        Density of man = Mass of man / Volume of man
        Density of man = w / (0.06 - 6h) kg/m^3
        But we know that the density of a man is approximately 1000 kg/m^3.
        Therefore, w / (0.06 - 6h) = 1000
        w = 1000(0.06 - 6h)
        58.8h = 1000(0.06 - 6h)
        58.8h = 60 - 600h
        658.8h = 60
        h = 0.0912 m
        Therefore, the weight of the man is:
        w = 58.8h = 58.8 x 0.0912 = 5.37 kg
        which is approximately 72 kg.

    <div class="solution">The change in frequency due to the Doppler effect is given by:
f' = f*(v_sound+v_observer)/(v_sound+v_source)
where f is the frequency of the wave, f' is the observed frequency, v_sound is the velocity of sound, v_observer is the velocity of the observer, and v_source is the velocity of the source.
In this case, the source and observer are moving in the same direction with the same velocity, so we can consider the relative velocity between them to be zero. Therefore, the observed frequency will be the same as the emitted frequency, and there will be no change in frequency.

So, the answer is (c) 0%.</div>

    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(b) Average velocity can be calculated by dividing the total displacement by total time. Here, the velocity is changing with time, so we cannot directly use this formula. Instead, we can use the formula for average speed, which is (total distance) / (total time). The distance covered in the first half of the time is (30 m/s) * (t/2), and the distance covered in the second half of the time is (40 m/s) * (t/2). Therefore, the total distance covered is (30 m/s + 40 m/s) * (t/2) = 35t. The total time taken is t, since the body travels with two different velocities for equal periods of time. Therefore, the average speed is (total distance) / (total time) = 35t / t = 35 m/s. So, the average velocity is also 35 m/s, since the velocity and speed are equal in this case.</div>
