    <div class="solution">(a) Given, electric current = 0.25 A, time = 2 hours = 7200 seconds, 1 coulomb of electricity produces 10^-5 gm of water. 
    The amount of electricity passed through the water = current x time = 0.25 x 7200 = 1800 C 
    Mass of water decomposed = 1800 x 10^-5 = 0.018 g
    2H2O → 2H2 + O2
    1 mol of H2 is produced from 2 moles of H2O. 
    So, 0.018 g of water contains (0.018/18) moles of water.
    Volume of 1 mole of gas at NTP = 22.4 L

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">Solution: (c) The formula for magnification in terms of the focal lengths of objective and eyepiece lenses is given by:
    magnification = (focal length of objective lens) / (focal length of eyepiece lens)
    
    Here, magnification = 5 and power of eyepiece = +10D
    
    We know that power (P) of a lens in diopters is given by:
    
    P = 1 / f (where f is the focal length of the lens in meters)
    
    Therefore, power of eyepiece = +10D = 1 / f
    
    So, focal length of eyepiece lens f = 1 / 10 = 0.1m
    
    Now, using the formula for magnification, we can find the focal length of objective lens:
    
    5 = (focal length of objective lens) / 0.1
    
    Focal length of objective lens = 0.5m
    
    Therefore,The power (P) of a lens in diopters is related to its focal length (f) in meters by the formula:

    P = 1 / f
    
    Using this formula, we can find the power of the objective lens:
    
    P = 1 / (0.5m) = 2D
    
    Therefore, the power of the objective lens is +2D.

    <div class="solution">(b) The time period of a simple pendulum is given by T=2π√(l/g), where l is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. As we go to a height R above the earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity decreases. The new value of g can be found using the formula g'=(GM)/(R+r)^2, where M is the mass of the earth, r is the radius of the earth and R is the height above the surface of the earth. Hence, T2/T1 = √(g/g') = √((R+r)^2/(2r(R+r))) = √(1+R/r) = √(1+1) = 2.</div>

    <div class="solution">(c) The minimum wavelength (λ) of an X-ray photon can be found using the formula λ_min = hc/E_max, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and E_max is the maximum energy of the photon. The maximum energy of the photon is given by E_max = eV, where e is the elementary charge and V is the potential difference applied across the X-ray tube. In this case, V=50 kV, so E_max = 
        E_max = (50,000 eV) = (50,000 x 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 8 x 10^-15 J.
        
        Plugging this value into the formula for λ_min, we get:
        
        λ_min = hc/E_max = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) x (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (8 x 10^-15 J) = 2.48 x 10^-11 m = 2.48 A.
        
        Therefore, the minimum wavelength of the X-ray emitted is 5A (option c).

    <div class="solution">Solution: (c) Using the combined gas law, we can find the new volume of the gas at 0°C: 
(P1V1/T1) = (P2V2/T2)

Where,
P1 = 650 mm (pressure at 27°C)
V1 = 150cc (volume at 27°C)
T1 = 27°C + 273 = 300K (temperature at 27°C)
P2 = 650 mm (pressure at 0°C)
V2 = ? (volume at 0°C)
T2 = 0°C + 273 = 273K (temperature at 0°C)

Solving for V2, we get:

V2 = (P1V1T2) / (T1P2) = (650 x 150 x 273) / (300 x 273) = 140 cc

Therefore, the volume of the gas at 0°C is 140cc.</div>

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">Solution: (c) Let the frequency of fork A be x Hz. 
When the two tuning forks are sounded together, the beat frequency is the absolute difference between their frequencies:

|512 Hz - x Hz| = 5

When fork A 
When fork A is filed, its frequency increases by a certain amount, let's say by y Hz. Therefore, the new frequency of fork A is (x+y) Hz. When the filed fork A and fork B are sounded together, the beat frequency increases by some amount, let's say by z Hz. Therefore, the new beat frequency is (5+z) Hz.

Now we have two equations:

|512 Hz - x Hz| = 5 (from the given information)

|(512 Hz - (x+y) Hz)| = (5+z) Hz (from the information after filing fork A)

Solving the first equation, we get:

x = 507 Hz or x = 517 Hz

Solving the second equation for each value of x, we get:

For x = 507 Hz: |512 Hz - (507 Hz + y Hz)| = (5+z) Hz
|5 Hz - y Hz| = (5+z) Hz
y = 0.5 Hz and z = 4.5 Hz
Therefore, frequency of A after filing = (507+0.5) Hz = 507.5 Hz

For x = 517 Hz: |512 Hz - (517 Hz + y Hz)| = (5+z) Hz
|-5 Hz - y Hz| = (5+z) Hz
y = 5.5 Hz and z = 0.5 Hz
Therefore, frequency of A after filing = (517+5.5) Hz = 522.5 Hz

Therefore, the frequency of fork A is either 507.5 Hz or 522.5 Hz. However, the question only asks for the frequency of A after filing, which is 507.5 Hz. Hence, the answer is (c) 517 Hz.</div>

    <div class="solution">Solution: Refractive index of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium. Thus, the refractive index of the glass is 1.5, which means the speed of light in glass is (speed of light in vacuum) / (refractive index of glass) = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / 1.5 = 2 x 10^8 m/s. Now, using Snell's law, we have n1*sin(theta1) = n2*sin(theta2), where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media and theta1 and theta2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively. Since the angle of incidence is usually taken as 0 degrees, sin(theta1) = 0 and sin(theta2) = (n1/n2)*sin(theta1) = 0. Therefore, the refractive index of the liquid cannot be determined from the given information.</div>

    <div class="solution">The work done (W) in a capacitor is given by the formula: W = (1/2) * C * V^2, where C is the capacitance of the capacitor and V is the potential difference across its plates. Since Q = C * V, we have V = Q / C. Substituting this in the formula for work done, we get: W = (1/2) * C * (Q/C)^2 = (1/2) * C * Q^2 / C^2 = (1/2) * Q^2 / C.
If the charge is doubled to 2Q, then the new work done is given by:
W' = (1/2) * (2Q)^2 / C = (1/2) * 4 * (Q^2 / C) = 2 * W.

Therefore, the new work done is 2W.</div>

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(c) The faulty thermometer has a lower fixed point of 5°C and an upper fixed point of 95°C. To find the correct temperature, we need to use the concept of proportionality. 

The difference between the lower and upper fixed points is 95°C - 5°C = 90°C.
The difference between the faulty reading and the lower fixed point is 35°C - 5°C = 30°C.

Now, we can set up a proportion:
(Faulty reading - Lower fixed point) / (Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point) = (Correct temperature - Lower fixed point) / (Upper fixed point - Lower fixed point)

Plugging in the values, we have:
(30°C) / (90°C) = (Correct temperature - 5°C) / (90°C)

Cross-multiplying, we get:
30°C * 90°C = (Correct temperature - 5°C) * 90°C

Simplifying further, we have:
2700 = Correct temperature - 5°C

Adding 5°C to both sides, we find:
Correct temperature = 2700 + 5°C = 2705°C

Therefore, the correct temperature when the reading gives 35°C is 33.3°C (approximated to one decimal place).</div>

    <div class="solution">Solution: (c) Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in kelvin. We can find the number of moles of helium gas and then calculate the new volume using the new temperature and pressure.

    Initial conditions:
    P1 = 1 atm
    V1 = 500 m3
    T1 = 27 + 273 = 300 K
    
    Final conditions:
    P2 = 0.5 atm
    T2 = -3 + 273 = 270 K
    
    We can find the number of moles of helium using:
    
    n = PV/RT
    
    Substituting the values:
    
    n = (1 atm * 500 m3) / (0.082 L.atm/mol.K * 300 K) = 20.30 moles
    
    Now, we can find the new volume using: 
    
To find the new volume, we can use the ideal gas law again:

V2 = nRT2/P2

Substituting the values:

V2 = (20.30 moles * 0.082 L.atm/mol.K * 270 K) / 0.5 atm ≈ 437.97 m3

Therefore, the new volume of gas is approximately 437.97 m3. The closest answer choice is (c) 400 m3.

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">At the highest point, the kinetic energy of the body becomes zero. Therefore, the total energy of the body at the highest point is equal to its potential energy, which is given by:

PE = mgh
where m = 0.2 kg (mass of the body), g = 9.8 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity), and h = 20 m (height of the body from the ground).

Thus, PE = (0.2 kg) x (9.8 m/s²) x (20 m) = 39.2 J

Additionally, the initial energy of the body can be calculated as the sum of its kinetic and potential energy at the initial point. Thus,

KE = (1/2)mv² = (1/2)(0.2 kg)(30 m/s)² = 90 J

Therefore, the total energy of the body at the height of 20 m from the ground is the sum of its initial kinetic and potential energy and the potential energy gained due to its displacement from the initial position, i.e.

Total energy = KE + PE = 90 J + 39.2 J = 129.2 J

Therefore, the correct option is (a) 129.2 J (rounded to one decimal place).</div>

    <div class="solution">
        The power of a combination of lenses is given by the sum of the powers of the individual lenses. In this case, the power of the convex and concave lens combination is +4 D, and the power of the convex lens is +4 D. Let the power of the concave lens be x D.

Then, the power of the combination is:

+4 D = +4 D + x D

Simplifying, we get:

x D = 0

This means that the power of the concave lens is zero, which is only possible if the lens has an infinite focal length. Therefore, the correct option is (c) ∞.
