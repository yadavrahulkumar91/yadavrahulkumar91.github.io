    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(c) When two dissimilar insulating materials are rubbed together, the friction causes electrons to transfer from one material to the other, resulting in the transfer of charge. In this case, ebonite (a type of plastic) has a greater affinity for electrons than air, so electrons are transferred from air to ebonite. As a result, ebonite becomes negatively charged, while air becomes positively charged. Since the radius of rod A is smaller than that of rod B, rod A will be charged more negatively than rod B.</div>

    <div class="solution">(c) The power of ionization of a particle refers to its ability to ionize atoms or molecules in its path. Gamma particles are high-energy photons that do not carry any charge and therefore do not ionize atoms through direct interactions. However, they can indirectly ionize atoms by producing electron-positron pairs when interacting with matter. The power of ionization of gamma particles is less than that of alpha and beta particles, which are charged particles and have a greater ability to ionize atoms, but greater than that of beta particles alone.</div>

    <div class="solution">(a) After the coalescence of two drops of water, the new velocity can be calculated using the principle of conservation of linear momentum.

    <div class="solution">(c) The radius of an electron orbit in a hydrogen atom is directly proportional to the square of the principal quantum number (n^2). Given that the radius increases from 0.53 Å to 2.12Å, we can calculate the ratio of the squares of the radii: (2.12/0.53)^2 = 16.

    <div class="solution">(b) When a tube closed at one end is excited, it produces a fundamental frequency equal to the frequency of the second harmonic. When the tube is open at both ends, it produces a fundamental frequency equal to the frequency of the first harmonic. Therefore, the fundamental frequency that can be excited is half of the frequency of the closed-end tube, which is 256 Hz.</div>

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(c) The time period of a pendulum is given by T=2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The coefficient of linear expansion of brass is α_brass=2×10^(−5)°C^(−1). Therefore, the change in the length of the pendulum with the temperature can be given as ΔL=Lα_brassΔT. Substituting the values, we get ΔT=15°C and ΔL/L=0.0003. Thus, the change in the time period of the pendulum can be given by ΔT/T=ΔL/2L=0.00015. The time period of the pendulum is 1 day/ (86400 s/day) × (T/2π) = 86164 s/T. Therefore, the change in the time period of the pendulum is 86164 s/T × 0.00015 = 12.2 s/day. Thus, the clock will lose 24.6 seconds per day, which is the correct answer.</div>

            </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(b) The rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings. Let the time taken to cool from 65°C to 60°C be t1 and the time taken to cool from 60°C to 55°C be t2. Therefore, we have:
            (65 - Ts) = k1 t1, and (60 - Ts) = k2 t2, where Ts is the temperature of the surroundings and k1 and k2 are constants of proportionality.
            Dividing the two equations, we get:
            t1/t2 = (65 - Ts)/(60 - Ts)
            Substituting the given values, we get:
            t1/t2 = 5/4
            Therefore, t2 = (4/5) × t1
            Since t1 is given as 5 minutes, t2 will be:
            t2 = (4/5) × 5 minutes = 4 minutes. Thus, the correct answer is (b) less than 5 minutes.</div>
