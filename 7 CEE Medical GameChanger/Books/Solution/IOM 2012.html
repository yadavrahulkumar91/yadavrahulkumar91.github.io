    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(a) Zero. The change in velocity in a circular path is directed towards the center of the circle, which is called centripetal acceleration. However, the magnitude of velocity remains constant if the speed is constant. Therefore, in a circular path, the change in velocity is zero.</div>

    <div class="solution">The escape velocity (Ve) of a planet is given by the formula Ve = sqrt((2GM)/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is the radius of the planet. As the mean density of the planet is the same as that of the Earth, we can assume that the mass of the planet is also double that of the Earth, since density = mass/volume, and volume = (4/3)πR^3. Therefore, M = (4/3)π(2R)^3ρ = (32/3)πR^3ρ. Substituting this value of M in the formula for Velocity, we get it.</div>

        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="solution">(a) The temperature when the thermometer reads 25°C can be calculated using the proportion of the temperature scale between the freezing and boiling points. Since the scale is divided into 100 equal parts, the temperature difference between freezing and boiling is 99 - 1 = 98. The difference between the given temperature and the freezing point is 25 - 1 = 24. Therefore, the temperature when it reads 25°C is (24/98) * 100 = 24.49°C, which can be rounded to 24.4°C.</div>

    <div class="solution">(b) The amount of heat conducted per unit time is proportional to the product of the cross-sectional area and the temperature difference. In this case, the diameters of the rods are in the ratio 1:1, so their cross-sectional areas are also in the ratio 1:1. The lengths of the rods are in the ratio 2:1, so the temperature difference along the length is also in the ratio 2:1.

    <div class="solution">(d) The decay constant represents the fraction of radioactive material that decays per unit time. To find the decay constant, we can use the formula: decay constant = -ln(Nf/Ni) / t, where Nf is the final amount, Ni is the initial amount, and t is the time. In this case, Nf/Ni = 12.5% = 0.125 and t = 90 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get decay constant = -ln(0.125) / 90 ≈ 0.0467/day.</div>
