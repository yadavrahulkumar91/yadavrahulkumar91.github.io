            <div class="solution">(c) The rate of voltage remains constant with power loss. Power loss in a
                transmission line is primarily caused by resistance. However, the voltage at the source remains
                constant regardless of the power loss. The power loss leads to a decrease in current, but the
                voltage remains constant as long as there are no other factors affecting it.</div>

            <div class="solution">(d) The speed of sound in solids is greater than in liquids because the density is
                maximum in solids. The speed of sound in a medium depends on its elasticity and density. While
                solids generally have higher elasticity than liquids, it is the higher density of solids compared to
                liquids that contributes to the higher speed of sound. The particles in a solid are tightly packed,
                resulting in a higher density and faster propagation of sound waves compared to the relatively
                looser arrangement of particles in liquids.</div>

                Echolocation is a technique used by bats and some other animals to navigate and detect objects in
                their environment. Bats emit high-frequency ultrasonic sound waves and listen for the echoes
                reflected back from objects in their surroundings. By analyzing the time it takes for the echoes to
                return and the changes in frequency and amplitude, bats can determine the location, size, and shape
                of objects in the dark.</div>

                passes through a prism, it gets dispersed into its constituent colors due to the phenomenon of
                dispersion. Each color of light has a different refractive index in the prism, and as a result, they
                bend or deviate at different angles. Violet light, being at the shorter wavelength end of the
                visible spectrum, experiences the highest degree of deviation (greater angle) compared to other
                colors like red, green, or yellow.</div>

                $n = 1 + \left( \frac{1}{f} \right) \left( \frac{1}{R} \right)$


                In this case, the lens is a planoconvex lens with one flat surface (infinite radius of curvature)
                and one curved surface with a radius of curvature (R) equal to 10 cm. The focal length (f) is 30 cm.
                By substituting these values into the lens-maker's formula, we can solve for the refractive index
                (n). The calculation gives us:

                speed (v²) of gas molecules in a sample is a measure of their average kinetic energy. According to
                the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to
                the temperature of the gas. As the temperature increases, the molecules gain more kinetic energy,
                resulting in higher mean square speed. The relationship is given by the equation:
                $v^2 = \frac{3kT}{m}$



                where v is the mean square speed, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and m is the
