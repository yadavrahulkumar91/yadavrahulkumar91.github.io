                sphere. In this case, the potential of the sphere is 100V, which means the potential difference between
                the sphere and far away is 100V. Since the sphere is at a potential of 100V and the potential at far
                away is 0V, the charge on the sphere is \(Q = CV\), where \(C\) is the capacitance of the sphere and

            <div class="solution">(a) The net potential at the center of the cube due to identical charges at each
                corner can be calculated by considering the contributions from each charge. The potential due to a point
                charge \(q\) at a distance \(r\) is given by the formula \(V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r}\).
                Since

                the charges are at the corners of the cube, the distance from each charge to the center of the cube is
                \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}\). Considering the symmetry of the cube, the contributions from the charges cancel
                out along the diagonals, and only the contributions along the axes remain. Each axis has two charges, so
                the net potential at the center of the cube is the sum of the potentials due to two charges along one
                axis. Therefore, the net potential at the center of the cube is \(V_{\text{net}} = 2 \times
                \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}}\). Simplifying, we get \(V_{\text{net}} =

            <div class="solution">(a) The potential difference (\(V\)) between two points is given by \(V =
                \frac{Q}{C}\), where \(Q\) is the charge and \(C\) is the capacitance. The capacitance of a sphere is
                given by \(C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 r\), where \(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space and \(r\) is
                the radius of the sphere.

                For the first sphere with a radius of 10 cm and a potential of 150 V:
                \(150 = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \cdot 10}\)

                For the second sphere with a radius of 15 cm and a potential of 100 V:
                \(100 = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \cdot 15}\)

                Dividing the two equations, we get:
                \(\frac{150}{100} = \frac{\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \cdot 10}}{\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \cdot 15}}\)

                Simplifying, we find:
                \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{10}\)

                Therefore, the charge on the first sphere (\(Q\)) is 2 times the elementary charge (e.s.u.), which is

            <div class="solution">(b) When a negatively charged ebonite rod is brought near sphere A, it induces a
                separation of charges in A. The negative charges in A are attracted to the rod, while the positive
                charges are repelled. This redistribution of charges leaves A with an excess of negative charges,
                resulting in a negative charge on A. When A and B are in contact, the excess negative charges from A
                flow to B, neutralizing A and leaving B with a negative charge acquired from A. Therefore, A will have a
                negative charge, and B will have a positive charge.</div>

            <div class="solution">(b) In an equilateral triangle, the distance between any two charges is the same. The
                force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: \(F = \frac{{kq^2}}{{r^2}}\), where \(k\) is the
                electrostatic constant, \(q\) is the charge, and \(r\) is the separation between them. In this case, all
                charges have the same magnitude of \(+1 \mu C\).

                Considering two adjacent charges, the net force on either charge due to the other two charges is the
                vector sum of the forces. Since the forces are equal in magnitude and directed towards the charges, they
                can be represented as two equal vectors with an angle of \(120^\circ\) between them. Using

                the parallelogram law of vector addition, the net force is given by:

                \(F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F^2 + F^2 + 2F \cdot F \cdot \cos(120^\circ)}\)

                Simplifying, we find:

                \(F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{3F^2}\)

                Therefore, the net force on either charge is \(\sqrt{3}F\).</div>

                        <div class="solution">(a) Let's denote the charges on the two spheres as \(q_1\) and \(q_2\),
                            where \(q_1\) is the smaller charge. According to the problem, \(q_1 + q_2 = 40 \, \mu C\)
                            and the magnitude of the repulsive force between them is 2.0 N when they are 50 cm (or 0.5
                            m) apart.

                            The electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: \(F =
                            \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\), where \(r\) is the separation between the
                            charges and \(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space.

                            We can set up the equation for the repulsive force as \(2.0 \, \text{N} =
                            \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{(0.5)^2}\).

                            Using the value of \(\epsilon_0\) and rearranging the equation, we get \(q_1 q_2 = (2.0
                            \times 4\pi\times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times (0.5)^2) \, \text{C}^2\).

                            Now, we need to find the values of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) that satisfy the equation \(q_1 + q_2
                            = 40 \, \mu C\) and \(q_1 q_2 = (2.0 \times 4\pi\times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times (0.5)^2)
                            \, \text{C}^2\).

                            Solving these equations, we find \(q_1 \approx 1.4 \, \mu C\) and \(q_2 \approx 38.6 \, \mu
                            C\).

                            Therefore, the magnitude of the smaller charge is approximately 1.4 μC.</div>

                            through the process of friction. The type of charge acquired depends on the materials
                            involved.

                            When a glass rod is rubbed with ebonite (a type of hard rubber), the glass rod becomes

                            compared to ebonite, so it gains electrons and becomes positively charged.

                            When a charged object is brought near a gold leaf electroscope, the charges on the
                            electroscope redistribute, causing the gold leaf to diverge. By observing the divergence of
                            the gold leaf, we can determine the presence and sign (positive or negative) of the charge

                            When these two spheres are made in contact, charge transfer occurs due to the redistribution

                            Given Q = 120μC, we want to find the value of q that maximizes q * (120μC - q).

                            To find the maximum value, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to q
                            and set it equal to zero:

                            d/dq [q * (120μC - q)] = 0
                            120μC - 2q = 0
                            2q = 120μC
                            q = 60μC

                            Therefore, the value of the charge between the two parts that will be maximum is q = 60μC.

                            charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (Coulomb's
                            Law).

                            Let's assume the original distance between the charges is d. When the distance is increased
                            by 25%, the new distance becomes d + 0.25d = 1.25d.

                            The percentage change in force can be calculated as:

                            Percentage change in force = (|Original force - New force| / Original force) * 100%

                            Since the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the relationship
                            can be expressed as:

                            Force ∝ 1/d^2

                            Using this relationship, we can write:

                            Original force / New force = (d / 1.25d)^2 = (1 / 1.25^2) = 0.64

                            Percentage change in force = (|1 - 0.64| / 1) * 100% = 36%

                            Therefore, the correct option is (c) - 65%.</div>

                            B, the charge on A gets distributed between the two spheres. According to the law of
                            conservation of charge, the total charge remains the same.

                            Let the charge remaining on sphere A be q. Since the charges distribute uniformly over the
                            surfaces, the ratio of the charges on sphere A and sphere B is equal to the ratio of their
                            surface areas.

                            \(\frac{q}{Q} = \frac{A_A}{A_B}\)

                            The surface area of a sphere is given by \(A = 4\pi r^2\).

                            Substituting the values, we have:

                            \(\frac{q}{Q} = \frac{4\pi a^2}{4\pi b^2}\)

                            Simplifying, we get:

                            The potential at a point due to a point charge \(q\) is given by the formula \(V =
                            \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r}\), where \(r\) is the distance from the charge to the
                            point.

                            In this case, since the charges are at the corners of the cube, the distance from each
                            charge to the center of the cube is \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}\) (using Pythagoras' theorem).

                            The potential at the center due to each charge is \(V_1 =
                            \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}}\).

                            Since all charges are identical, the potential due to each charge is the same.

                            Therefore, the net potential at the center of the cube is \(V_{net} =
                            \frac{2q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{2q}{\sqrt{3}\pi\epsilon_0a}\).

                            whether charged or uncharged, are associated with matter waves.

                            The concept of matter waves is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, described by
                            the wave-particle duality. It states that particles, such as electrons and other subatomic
                            particles, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.

                            The matter waves associated with particles are described by wavefunctions, which represent
                            the probability distribution of finding the particle in different states. These matter waves
                            have wave-like properties, such as interference and diffraction, which have been

                            (\(E\)) decreases.

                            Inside a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field is directly proportional to the
                            distance from the center of the sphere. As you move deeper into the sphere, the distance
                            from the center decreases, and thus, the electric field strength decreases.

                            At the surface of the sphere, the electric field is the highest, and as you move towards the
                            center, it gradually decreases until it reaches zero at the center.

                            Therefore, the electric field strength decreases on penetrating a uniformly charged sphere.

                            Since pairs (1,2) and (4,1) show electrostatic attraction, ball 1 must have an opposite
                            charge to ball 2, i.e., ball 1 must be positively charged.

                            increases as the separation \(r\) decreases.

                            At point P, the potential is at a minimum, indicating that the intermolecular force is
                            attractive. Therefore, the molecules can be in equilibrium at point P.

                            At a distance \(r > r_o\), where \(r_o\) is the separation at point P, the potential is

                        \(q_1\) being the smaller charge.

                        According to Coulomb's law, the electrostatic force between two charges is given by:

                        \[F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}\]

                        Given that the force between the spheres is 2.0 N and the distance between them is 50 cm, we can
                        write:

                        \[2.0 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot 40 \times 10^{-6}|}{(0.5)^2}\]

                        Simplifying, we find:

                        \[|q_1| = \frac{2.0 \times (0.5)^2}{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot 40 \times 10^{-6}}\]

                        The value of \(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\) is approximately \(9 \times 10^9\) Nm\(^2\)/C\(^2\).
                        Plugging in the values, we get:

                        \[|q_1| = \frac{2.0 \times (0.5)^2}{9 \times 10^9 \cdot 40 \times 10^{-6}}\]

                        Calculating this expression, we find:

                        \[|q_1| \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-6}\, \text{C}\]

                        Therefore, the magnitude of the smaller charge is approximately 1.4 μC.
