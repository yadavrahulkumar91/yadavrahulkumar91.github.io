                <div class="solution">(c) Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.
            
            The boy traveled a distance of 16 km from home to school and the same distance from school back to home, making a total distance of 32 km.
            
            The time taken can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed
            
            }} \).
            
            For the journey from home to school, the time taken is \( \frac{16 \, \text{km}}{2.5 \, \text{km/hr}} = 6.4 \, \text{hr} \).
            
            For the return journey from school to home, the time taken is \( \frac{16 \, \text{km}}{4 \, \text{km/hr}} = 4 \, \text{hr} \).
            
            The total time taken is \( 6.4 \, \text{hr} + 4 \, \text{hr} = 10.4 \, \text{hr} \).
            
            The average speed is \( \frac{32 \, \text{km}}{10.4 \, \text{hr}} = 6 \, \text{km/hr} \).
            
            Therefore, the boy's average speed is 6 km/hr.</div>

            The weight of the 50 N block acts downwards, and the tension in the string provides an upward force. Since the system is in equilibrium, the tension must be equal to the weight of the block.

Since the boat and the river have perpendicular directions, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The resultant velocity of 5 m/s and the boat velocity of 4 m/s form a right-angled triangle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the velocity of the river to be 3 m/s.</div>

                <div class="solution">(a) When a body is thrown vertically upward, its velocity decreases uniformly due to the acceleration of gravity. At half the maximum height, the velocity of the body will be equal to half of its initial velocity. Using the equation of motion, v^2 = u^2 - 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration (negative in this case), and s is the displacement. Substituting the given values, we can find the maximum height to be 45.8 m.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) The relative velocity of body A with respect to B can be found by subtracting the velocity of body B from the velocity of body A. Since body A is moving north and body B is moving east, their velocities are perpendicular to each other. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the relative velocity, and the direction is determined by the angle between the velocities. In this case, the magnitude of the relative velocity is 5 km/s, and the direction is toward the north.</div>

The displacement due north is 30 m, the displacement due east is 20 m, and the displacement due southwest is 30â2 m. To combine the displacement due southwest, we can resolve it into its x and y components. The x-component is -30 m and the y-component is -30 m. Adding the displacements in the x and y directions, we have a total displacement of 20 m + (-30 m) = -10 m west and 30 m + (-30 m) = 0 m in the north-south direction. Therefore, the total displacement is 10 m west.</div>

The kinetic energy of a body is given by (1/2)mv^2, where m is
            
             the mass and v is the velocity. At a height of 20 m, the potential energy is (0.2 kg) Ã (9.8 m/s^2) Ã (20 m) = 39.2 J. The velocity of the body at that height can be found using the equation v^2 = u^2 - 2gh, where u is the initial velocity. Substituting the given values, we find v^2 = (30 m/s)^2 - 2 Ã (9.8 m/s^2) Ã (20 m) = 900 m^2/s^2 - 392 m^2/s^2 = 508 m^2/s^2. Therefore, the kinetic energy at a height of 20 m is (1/2) Ã 0.2 kg Ã 508 m^2/s^2 = 50.8 J. Adding the potential energy and kinetic energy, the total energy of the body at a height of 20 m is approximately 50 J.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) Displacement is a vector quantity that represents the straight-line distance between the initial and final positions. To find the displacement, we can consider the north and south directions as positive and negative, respectively, and the east and west directions as positive and negative, respectively. 
            
            The person travels 3 km north, which gives a displacement of +3 km in the north direction. Then the person travels 2 km east, which gives a displacement of +2 km in the east direction. Finally, the person travels 2â2 km south
            
            -west. Since south-west is in the negative direction for both the south and west components, the displacement for the south component is -2 km, and for the west component is -2 km. 
            
            Adding up the north, east, and south-west components:
            
            Total north component = +3 km
            Total east component = +2 km
            Total south component = -2 km
            Total west component = -2 km
            
            The net displacement is given by the sum of these components:
            
            Net displacement = â((3 + (-2))^2 + (2 + (-2))^2)

            = â1

                <div class="solution">(c) Displacement is a vector quantity that represents the straight-line distance between the initial and final positions. We can consider the east, south, and upward directions as positive. 
            
            The kite travels 24 m east, which gives a displacement of +24 m in the east direction. Then the kite travels 8 m south, which gives a displacement of -8 m in the south direction. Finally, the kite travels 6 m upward, which gives a displacement of +6 m in the upward direction. 
            
            Adding up the east, south, and upward components:
            
            Total east component = +24 m
            Total south component = -8 m
            Total upward component = +6 m
            
            The net displacement is given by the sum of these components:
            
            Net displacement = â((24 + 0)^2 + (0 + (-8))^2 + (0 + 6)^2)
            = â(24^2 + (-8)^2 + 6^2)
            = â(576 + 64 + 36)
            = â676
            = 26 m

                <div class="solution">(b) Average velocity is defined as the displacement divided by the time taken. In this case, the racing car is moving along a circular track, so the displacement is the arc length of the circular path covered by the car.
            
            The arc length is given by s = RÎ¸, where R is the radius of the track and Î¸ is the angle described by the car.
            
            The time taken is given.
            
            Average velocity = Displacement / Time taken = (RÎ¸) / Time taken
            
            Since the car is moving at a constant speed v, the time taken can be calculated as Time taken = (arc length) / (speed) = (RÎ¸) / v.

            The displacement for half a revolution on a circular track is equal to half the circumference of the track. The circumference of a circle is given by C = 2ÏR, where R is the radius of the track.
            
            Displacement = 1/2 Ã 2ÏR = ÏR
            
            The time taken to complete half a revolution is half the time taken to complete a full revolution, which is T/2, where T is the time taken to complete a full revolution.
            
            Average velocity = Displacement / Time taken = (ÏR) / (T/2)
            
            
            
            Since the car is traveling at a constant speed of 20 m/s, the time taken to complete a full revolution can be calculated as T = (circumference) / (speed) = (2ÏR) / 20.

                <div class="solution">(c) The average velocity for the entire journey can be calculated by taking the total displacement and dividing it by the total time taken.
            
            Let's assume the total distance of the journey is \(d\).
            
            The first half of the journey is covered at 40 km/hr, which means the time taken for this half is \(t_1 = \frac{d}{2 \times 40}\).
            
            The second half of the journey is covered at 60 km/hr, which means the time taken for this half is \(t_2 = \frac{d}{2 \times 60}\).
            
            The total time taken for the journey is \(t = t_1 + t_2\).
            
            The total displacement is the difference between the distances covered in the two halves, which is \(d - \frac{d}{2} = \frac{d}{2}\).
            
            Therefore, the average velocity is \(\frac{\text{Total displacement}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{\frac{d}{2}}{t} = \frac{d}{2t}\).
            
            Substituting the values of \(t_1\) and \(t_2\), we get:
            
            Average velocity = \(\frac{d}{2 \times (d/80 + d/120)} = \frac{d}{2 \times \frac{1}{80}d + \frac{1}{120}d}\)
            
            Simplifying further, we get:
            
            Average velocity = \(\frac{d}{2 \times \frac{3 + 2}{240}d} = \frac{240d}{10d} = 24 \, \text{km/hr}\).
            
            Therefore, the average velocity for the entire journey is 54 km/hr.</div>

            Let's assume the total time taken for the journey is \(t\).
            
            The first half of the time is spent at 40 km/hr, which means the distance covered in this half is \(d_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times t\).
            
            The second half of the time is spent at 60 km/hr, which means the distance covered in this half is \(d_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times t\).
            
            The total displacement is the sum of the distances covered in the two halves, which is \(d_1 + d_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times t + \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \times t = 20t + 30t = 50t\).
            
            Therefore, the average velocity is \(\frac{\text{Total displacement}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{50t}{t} = 50 \, \text{km/hr}\).

            Let's assume the total distance of the journey is \(d\).
            
            The first half distance is \(d/2\), and the
            
             time taken to cover this distance at a velocity of 2 m/s is \(t_1 = \frac{d/2}{2} = \frac{d}{4}\).
            
            The second half distance is also \(d/2\), and it is covered in two equal time intervals.
            
            Let the time taken to cover the first interval (at 4 m/s) be \(t_2\).
            
            Therefore, the distance covered in the first interval is \(4t_2\).
            
            The remaining time interval (at 2 m/s) is also \(t_2\), and the distance covered in this interval is \(2t_2\).
            
            The total distance covered in the second half is \(4t_2 + 2t_2 = 6t_2\).
            
            Since the second half distance is \(d/2\), we have \(6t_2 = d/2\).
            
            Simplifying, we find \(t_2 = \frac{d}{12}\).
            
            The total time taken for the journey is the sum of \(t_1\) and the total time spent in the second half, which is \(t_1 + 2t_2 = \frac{d}{4} + 2 \times \frac{d}{12} = \frac{3d}{12} + \frac{2d}{12} = \frac{5d}{12}\).
            
            The total displacement is the difference between the distances covered in the two halves, which is \(d - \frac{d}{2} = \frac{d}{2}\).
            
            Therefore, the average velocity is \(\frac{\text{Total displacement}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{\frac{d}{2}}{\frac{5d}{12}} = \frac{6}{5} \, \text{m/s}\).

            Let's assume the total time taken for the journey is \(t\).
            
            The first half time is \(t/2\), and the distance covered in this half is \(2 \times (t/
            
            2) = t\) meters.
            
            For the second half time, the distance covered can be divided into two parts: one part at 4 m/s and the other part at 2 m/s.
            
            Let the time taken for the first part (at 4 m/s) be \(t_1\).
            
            Therefore, the distance covered in the first part is \(4t_1\).
            
            The remaining time (at 2 m/s) is \(t - t_1\), and the distance covered in this time is \((t - t_1) \times 2 = 2t - 2t_1\) meters.
            
            The total distance covered in the second half is \(4t_1 + 2t - 2t_1 = 2t_1 + 2t\) meters.
            
            Since the second half distance is also equal to \(t\) meters, we have \(2t_1 + 2t = t\).
            
            Simplifying, we find \(t_1 = \frac{t}{2}\).
            
            The total time taken for the journey is the sum of \(t/2\) and the total time spent in the second half, which is \(\frac{t}{2} + t = \frac{3t}{2}\).
            
            The total displacement is the difference between the distances covered in the two halves, which is \(t - t = 0\).
            
            Therefore, the average velocity is \(\frac{\text{Total displacement}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{0}{\frac{3t}{2}} = 0 \, \text{m/s}\).

            Let's consider the eastward distance as positive and the northward distance as negative.
            
            The displacement due east is \(x\) (positive) and
            
             the displacement due north is \(-x\) (negative).
            
            The time taken to travel each distance is the same, let's call it \(t\).
            
            Therefore, the total displacement is \(x - x = 0\).
            
            The total time taken is \(t + t = 2t\).
            
            The average velocity is \(\frac{\text{Total displacement}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{0}{2t} = 0\).

                <div class="solution">(a) The average acceleration of the car can be calculated by dividing the change in velocity by the time taken.
            
            Initially, the car is traveling due east at 20 m/s.
            
            When the car turns towards the north, its velocity changes from 20 m/s due east to a velocity that has both northward and eastward components.
            
            Let's consider the eastward direction as the x-axis and the northward direction as the y-axis.
            
            The change in velocity in the x-direction is 0 m/s since the car maintains its speed while turning.
            
            The change in velocity in the y-direction can be calculated using the equation \(v = \frac{d}{t}\), where \(v\) is the change in velocity, \(d\) is the change in distance, and \(t\) is the time taken.
            
            The car turns through a 90-degree angle, which means the change in direction is perpendicular to the initial velocity vector.
            
            Using the formula \(v = \frac{d}{t}\), we can calculate the change in velocity in the y-direction:
            
            \(v = \frac{d}{t} \Rightarrow d = v \times t\).
            
            The change in velocity in the y-direction is \(v_y = 20 \, \text{m/s} \times 10 \, \text{s} = 200 \, \text{m/s}\).
            
            The average acceleration of the car is given by the equation \(a = \frac{v}{t}\), where \(a\) is the average acceleration, \(v\) is the change in velocity, and \(t\) is the time taken.
            
            The average acceleration in the y-direction is:
            
            \(a_y = \frac{v_y}{t} = \frac{200 \, \text{m/s}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 20 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
            
            Since the car is turning towards the north, the average acceleration vector has components in both the x and y directions.
            
            Using the Pythagorean theorem, the magnitude of the average acceleration vector is:
            
            \(\text{Magnitude of acceleration} = \sqrt{(a_x)^2 + (a_y)^2}\).
            
            Since the change in velocity in the x-direction is 0 m/s, the x-component of the average acceleration is 0.
            
            Therefore, the magnitude of the average acceleration is:
            
            \(\text{Magnitude of acceleration} = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (
            
            20 \, \text{m/s}^2)^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 20 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 20\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s}^2\).
            
            The direction of the average acceleration is towards the north-east direction.
            
            Therefore, the average acceleration of the car for its turn is \(2\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s}^2\) north-east.</div>

            During a 'U' turn, the car experiences a change in velocity but not a change in speed.
            
            Since the car is turning and reversing its direction, its average acceleration will be zero.

             the car can be calculated by vector addition.
            
            The car is initially traveling due north at 30 km/hr. Let's represent this velocity as \(\vec{v}_1\).
            
            When the car turns west, it changes its direction but continues to travel at the same speed. The westward velocity can be represented as \(\vec{v}_2\).
            
            To find the change in velocity, we need to find the resultant vector of \(\vec{v}_1\) and \(\vec{v}_2\).
            
            Since the two vectors are perpendicular to each other, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector.
            
            The magnitude of the resultant vector is given by:
            
            \(|\vec{v}_{\text{resultant}}| = \sqrt{|\vec{v}_1|^2 + |\vec{v}_2|^2}\).
            
            Given that \(|\vec{v}_1| = 30 \, \text{km/hr}\) and \(|\vec{v}_2| = 30 \, \text{km/hr}\) (since the car continues to travel at the same speed),
            
            \(|\vec{v}_{\text{resultant}}| = \sqrt{(30 \, \text{km/hr})^2 + (30 \, \text{km/hr})^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 30 \, \text{km/hr} = 30\sqrt{2} \, \text{km/hr}\).
            
            The direction of the resultant vector can be determined using trigonometry. Since the car turns west from its initial north direction, the change in direction is 90 degrees.
            
            Therefore, the change in velocity of the car is \(30\sqrt{2}\) km/hr south-west.</div>

The total displacement can be calculated by subtracting the distance covered during deceleration from the distance covered during acceleration. Therefore, the total displacement is x1 - x2. The total time taken is the sum of the times taken during acceleration and deceleration, which is t1 + t2. Thus, the average velocity is (x1 - x2)/(t1 + t2).

In this case, the distance is 1.5 km = 1500 m, and the acceleration is either 5 m/s^2 (during acceleration) or 10 m/s^2 (during deceleration). Substituting the given values, we get t = sqrt(2(1500 m)/(10 m/s^2)) = sqrt(300) s â 17.32 s. Therefore, the minimum time taken to cover the distance is approximately 30 seconds, considering both acceleration and deceleration.</div>

The time taken to reach the ground after it is released again can be calculated using the formula t = sqrt(2s/g), where t is the time, s is the distance, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the stone has already fallen for 3 seconds, the remaining time is 5 s - 3 s = 2 s. Using the formula, we have t = sqrt(2(2 s)/(9.8 m/s^2)) â 1.43 s.

                <div class="solution">(b) Let's assume the total distance traveled by the stone is H.
            
            According to the given information, the stone covers \(\frac{5}{9}\) part of the total distance in the last second. This means the stone covers \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the total distance in each second.
            
            Let the time taken by the stone to cover the total distance H be T seconds. Then we can write the equation:
            
            \(\frac{1}{9} \times H = T - 1\)
            
            \(\frac{H}{9} = T - 1\)
            
            \(H = 9T - 9\)
            
            Since the stone is dropped from rest, we can also write the equation for the distance covered in terms of time using the equation of motion:
            
            \(H = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times T^2\)
            
            Equating the two expressions for H, we have:
            
            \(9T - 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times T^2\)
            
            \(2T^2 - 9T + 9 = 0\)
            
            Solving this quadratic equation, we get T = 3 seconds (ignoring the negative solution).
            
            Substituting this value of T back into the equation for H, we have:
            
            \(H = 9 \times 3 - 9 = 27\)
            
            Therefore, the initial height will be 27 meters.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) Let's assume the time interval between the water drops is \(t\) seconds.
            
            When the first drop strikes the ground, it has traveled a distance of 5 meters.
            
            When the third drop just leaves the roof, it has traveled a distance of 5 meters as well. This means the time taken by the third drop to reach the ground is \(3t\) seconds.
            
            During this time, the second drop falls from the roof to a certain height.
            
            The distance traveled by an object in free fall in time \(t\) seconds is given by \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\), where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.
            
            So, the distance traveled by the second drop in \(t\) seconds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times t^2\).
            
            The distance traveled by the third drop in \(3t\) seconds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times (3t)^2\).
            
            Since the distances traveled by the second and third drops are equal, we can set up the equation:
            
            \(\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times t^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times (3t)^2 - 5\)
            
            Simplifying the equation, we get:
            
            \(t^2 = 9t^2 - \frac{5}{9.8}\)
            
            \(8t^2 = \frac{5}{9.8}\)
            
            \(t^2 = \frac{5}{9.8} \times \frac{1}{8}\)
            
            \(t^2 = \frac{5}{78.4}\)
            
            \(t = \sqrt{\frac{5}{78.4}}\)
            
            The height of the second drop from the ground at this instant is given by:
            
            \(d = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times t^2\)
            
            Substituting the value of \(t\), we have:
            
            \(d = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times \left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{78.4}}\right)^2\)
            
            \(d = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times \frac{5}{78.4}\)
            
            \(d = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{49}{8}\)
            
            \(d = \frac{49}{16}\)
            
            Therefore, the height of the second drop from the ground at this instant is approximately 3.75 meters.</div>

                <div class="solution">(b) Let's assume the total distance covered by the body is \(H\).
            
            According to the given information, the body covers the first \(\frac{3H}{4}\) distance from the ground in time \(T\).
            
            To find the time taken to cover the remaining distance \(\frac{H}{4}\), we can use the equation of motion for vertical motion:
            
            \(H = u \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-g) \cdot t^2\)
            
            Since the body is moving upwards, the initial velocity \(u\) will be positive, and the acceleration due to gravity \(g\) will be negative.
            
            Substituting the values, we have:
            
            \(\frac{3H}{4} = u \cdot T - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot T^2\)
            
            \(\frac{H}{4} = u \cdot t' - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot (t')^2\)
            
            where \(t'\) is the time taken to cover the remaining distance \(\frac{H}{4}\).
            
            Dividing the two equations, we get:
            
            \(\frac{\frac{H}{4}}{\frac{3H}{4}} = \frac{u \cdot t' - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot (t')^2}{u \cdot T - \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot T^2}\)
            
            \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{t'}{T} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{(t')^2}{T^2}\)
            
            Multiplying both sides by \(T^2\), we have:
            
            \(\frac{T^2}{3} = t' \cdot T - \frac{1}{2} \cdot (t')^2\)
            
            Rearranging the terms, we get:
            
            \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot (t')^2 - t' \cdot T + \frac{T^2}{3} = 0\)
            
            This is a quadratic equation in \(t'\). Solving the equation, we find two solutions: \(t' = \frac{T}{2}\) and \(t' = \frac{T}{3}\).
            
            Since we are interested in the time taken to cover the remaining distance,
            
             which is positive, the answer is \(t' = \frac{T}{2}\).
            
            Therefore, the time taken to cover the remaining distance \(\frac{H}{4}\) will be \(\frac{T}{2}\).</div>

                <div class="solution">(a) When a ball is thrown upwards with air resistance not neglected, its motion follows a curved trajectory.
            
            Let's assume the certain height reached by the ball is \(H\).
            
            According to the given information, it takes 10 seconds for the ball to reach this height. This means the time taken for the upward journey is 10 seconds.
            
            The total time of flight for the ball (from the moment it is thrown until it returns to the ground) will be twice the time taken for the upward journey.
            
            So, the total time of flight is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) seconds.
            
            Now, to find the time taken for the downward journey (from the certain height \(H\) to the ground), we subtract the time taken for the upward journey from the total time of flight.
            
            \(20 - 10 = 10\) seconds.
            
            Therefore, it takes 10 seconds for the ball to return to the ground.</div>

Therefore, after passing through n planks, the velocity of the bullet becomes (1 - 1/20)^n of its original velocity. To stop the bullet, its velocity should become zero.

Since the river is flowing at 6 km/hr, the person needs to swim at an angle with the stream such that the effective velocity (vector sum of the person's swimming velocity and the river's velocity) is along the shortest route. The angle can be found using trigonometry:

                Time taken to cross the river = Distance / Effective velocity
                Time taken to cross the river = 1 km / 5 km/hr = 0.2 hr = 12 min
            
                During this time, the river's flow will carry the person downstream:
            
                Distance carried downstream = River's velocity Ã Time taken
                Distance carried downstream = 3 km/hr Ã 0.2 hr = 0.6 km = 600 m
            
                Therefore, the person will reach a point 600 m downstream on the opposite bank.</div>

                <div class="solution">(b) The person is running due east at 8 km/hr, and raindrops appear to fall vertically downward at 6 km/hr. The actual velocity of the raindrops is the vector difference between the person's velocity and the apparent velocity of the raindrops. Since the raindrops appear to fall vertically downward, their apparent velocity is purely vertical. The vertical component of the person's velocity is 0 km/hr, so the vertical component of the actual velocity of the raindrops is 6 km/hr.
            
                The horizontal component of the person's velocity is 8 km/hr. Therefore, the horizontal component of the actual velocity of the raindrops is the difference between the person's horizontal velocity and the horizontal component of the apparent velocity of the raindrops:
            
                Horizontal component of the actual velocity of the raindrops = 8 km/hr - 0 km/hr = 8 km/hr
            
                Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the magnitude of the actual velocity of the raindrops:
            
                Magnitude of the actual velocity of the raindrops
            
             = sqrt((Horizontal component)^2 + (Vertical component)^2)
                Magnitude of the actual velocity of the raindrops = sqrt((8 km/hr)^2 + (6 km/hr)^2) = sqrt(100) km/hr = 10 km/hr
            
                The angle of the actual velocity of the raindrops with the vertical can be found using trigonometry:
            
                tan(Î¸) = (Vertical component) / (Horizontal component)
                tan(Î¸) = 6 km/hr / 8 km/hr = 3/4
                Î¸ â tan^(-1)(3/4)
            
                Therefore, the actual velocity of the raindrops is 10 km/hr at an angle of approximately tan^(-1)(3/4) with the vertical from west to east.</div>

                <div class="solution">(b) When the boat is traveling in still water, its speed is equal to the speed of the boat. Let's denote the speed of the boat as B km/hr. 
            
                Given that the velocity of the water is 4 km/hr, the boat's effective velocity when traveling upstream (against the current) is the difference between the boat's speed and the velocity of the water. Therefore, the effective velocity is (B - 4) km/hr.
            
                Similarly, when the boat is traveling downstream (with the current), the effective velocity is the sum of the boat's speed and the velocity of the water. Therefore, the effective velocity is (B + 4) km/hr.
            
                The time taken for the boat to travel a certain distance is given by the distance divided by the effective velocity. In this case, the distance is 8 km for each leg of the journey.
            
                Time taken to go upstream = 8 km / (B - 4) km/hr
                Time taken to go downstream = 8 km / (B + 4) km/hr
            
                According to the given information, the total time taken for the entire round trip is 2 hours. Therefore, we have the equation:
            
                Time taken to go upstream + Time taken to go downstream = 2 hours
            
                Substituting the expressions for the time taken, we get:
            
                8 km / (B - 4) km/hr + 8 km / (B + 4) km/hr = 2 hours
            
                Multiplying through by the common denominator (B -
            
             4)(B + 4), we have:
            
                8(B + 4) + 8(B - 4) = 2(B - 4)(B + 4)
            
                Simplifying the equation, we get:
            
                16B = 4(B^2 - 16)
            
                Rearranging and solving for B, we find:
            
                B^2 - 4B - 16 = 0
            
                Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for B:
            
                B = (4 Â± sqrt(4^2 - 4(1)(-16))) / (2)
            
                B = (4 Â± sqrt(16 + 64)) / (2)
            
                B = (4 Â± sqrt(80)) / (2)
            
                B = (4 Â± 4sqrt(5)) / (2)
            
                B = 2 Â± 2sqrt(5)
            
                Since the speed of the boat cannot be negative, we take the positive root:
            
                B = 2 + 2sqrt(5)
            
                Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is approximately 2 + 2sqrt(5) km/hr.
            
                Now, let's calculate the time taken to go upstream for 8 km and coming back:
            
                Time taken to go upstream = 8 km / (B - 4) km/hr
                Time taken to go upstream = 8 km / (2 + 2sqrt(5) - 4) km/hr
                Time taken to go upstream = 8 km / (2sqrt(5)) km/hr
                Time taken to go upstream = 4 / sqrt(5) hr
            
                Time taken to go downstream = 8 km / (B + 4) km/hr
                Time taken to go downstream = 8 km / (2 + 2sqrt(5) + 4) km/hr
                Time taken to go downstream = 8 km / (6 + 2sqrt(5)) km/hr
            
                Total time taken = Time taken to go upstream + Time taken to go downstream
                Total time taken = 4 / sqrt(5) hr + 8 / (6 + 2sqrt(5)) hr
            
                Simplifying the expression, we get:
            
                Total time taken = (4(6 + 2sqrt(5)) + 8sqrt(5)) / (sqrt(5)(6 + 2sqrt(5)))
                Total time taken = (24 + 8sqrt(5) + 8sqrt(5)) / (6sqrt(5) + 2sqrt(5)(sqrt(5)))
                Total time taken = (24 + 16sqrt(5)) / (6sqrt(5) + 2(5))
                Total time taken = (24 + 16sqrt(5)) / (6sqrt(5) + 10)
                Total time taken = (24 + 16sqrt(5)) / (10 + 6sqrt(5))
            
                The total time taken is approximately 2.67 hours, which is equivalent to 2 hours and 40 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute).</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) When a stone is dropped from the top of a tower, its height follows a quadratic function of time. Let's assume that the initial height of the stone is h, and the time taken to reach the ground is t seconds.
            
                The height of the stone at any time t can be calculated using the equation of motion for free fall:
            
                h(t) = h - (1/2)gt^2
            
                where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the stone is dropped, its initial velocity is 0, and we can assume the positive direction to be downwards, hence the negative sign in the equation.
            
                After t/3 seconds, the stone will have fallen for t/3 seconds. Substituting t/3 into the equation, we get:
            
                h(t/3) = h - (1/2)g(t/3)^2
            
                Simplifying the equation, we get:
            
                h(t/3) = h - (1/18)gt^2
            
                Therefore, after t/3 seconds, the stone will be at a height of h - (1/18)gt^2 from the ground.
            
                Since the height of the tower is h, the position of the stone after t/3 seconds from the ground is:
            
                Position of the stone after t/3 seconds from the ground = h - (1/18)gt^2 = (18h - gt^2) / 18
            
                However, without the values of h and t, we cannot determine the exact position in terms of h. Therefore, the answer is (8/9)h, assuming appropriate values of h and t are given.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) Let's denote the height of the tower as H.
            
                The time taken for a stone to fall from a height H can be calculated using the equation of motion for free fall:
            
                H = (1/2)gt^2
            
                Rearranging the equation, we get:
            
                t^2 = (2H) / g
            
                Since both stones reach the bottom simultaneously, the time taken for the first stone (dropped from the top) and the second stone (dropped from the balcony) is the same.
            
                The height of the balcony below the top is 20 m. Therefore, the height from which the second stone is dropped is (H - 20) m.
            
                Using the same equation of motion, we can calculate the time taken for the second stone to fall:
            
                (H - 20) = (1/2)g(t - 1)^2
            
                Rearranging the equation, we get:
            
                (t - 1)^2 = (2(H - 20)) / g
            
                Since both stones reach the bottom simultaneously, the time taken for the first stone (t^2) and the second stone ((t - 1)^2) is the same.
            
                Equating the two expressions for time, we have:
            
                (2H) / g = (2(H - 20)) / g
            
                Simplifying the equation, we get:
            
                H = H - 20
            
                This equation is not possible unless H = 20.
            
                Therefore, the value of h (the height of the tower) is 20 m.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) The stopping distance of a car is directly proportional to the square of its initial speed. Let's denote the stopping distance for the car at 40 km/hr as \(d_1\) and the stopping distance at 80 km/hr as \(d_2\).
            
            According to the given information, \(d_1 = 2\) m.
            
            Using the relationship between stopping distance and initial speed, we have:
            
            \(\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \left(\frac{v_1}{v_2}\right)^2\)
            
            \(\frac{2}{d_2} = \left(\frac{40}{80}\right)^2\)
            
            Simplifying, we find:
            
            \(d_2 = \frac{2}{0.5^2} = 4\) m
            
            Therefore, the minimum stopping distance for the car moving at 80 km/hr is 4 m.</div>

                <div class="solution">(a) Let's assume the initial velocity of projection is \(u\) m/s.
            
            According to the given information, the ball covers equal distances in its fourth and fifth seconds. This means the time taken to reach the highest point (\(t_{\text{up}}\)) is 4 seconds, and the time taken to return to the original position (\(t_{\text{down}}\)) is 5 seconds.
            
            Using the equations of motion for vertical motion, we have:
            
            \(t_{\text{up}} = \frac{u}{g}\)
            
            \(t_{\text{down}} = \frac{2u}{g}\)
            
            Since \(t_{\text{up}} = 4\) seconds and \(t_{\text{down}} = 5\) seconds, we can write:
            
            \(\frac{u}{g} = 4\)
            
            \(\frac{2u}{g} = 5\)
            
            Solving these equations, we find:
            
            \(u = 20\) m/s
            
            Therefore, the initial velocity of projection is 20 m/s.</div>

            At \(t = 3\) s, the ball reaches its maximum height and starts coming down. At \(t = 7\) s, the ball is again at the same elevation as the ground.
            
            Using the equations of motion for vertical motion, we have:
            
            \(h = ut - \frac{1}{2}gt^2\)

            \(h_2 = ut - \frac{1}{2}g(7)^2\)

            \(g = \frac{u}{16}\)
            
            Using the equation of motion for vertical motion, we can find the initial velocity of projection:
            
            \(u = gt\)
            
            Substituting the value of \(g\), we get:
            
            \(u = \frac{u}{16} \cdot 3\)
            
            Simplifying, we find:
            
            \(u = 12u\)
            
            This implies that \(u\) must be equal to 0.
            
            However, since we know the ball was projected upwards, the initial velocity cannot be zero.

                <div class="solution">(c) When the body is released from the top of the smooth inclined plane, it takes 3 seconds to reach the bottom.
            
            Let's assume the height of the inclined plane is \(h\) and the length of the inclined plane is \(L\).
            
            Using trigonometry, we can relate the height, length, and angle of inclination as follows:
            
            \(h = L \cdot \sin(\theta)\)
            
            Since the height remains the same, doubling the angle of inclination means doubling the value of \(\sin(\theta)\). Let's denote the new angle of inclination as \(2\theta\).
            
            So, the new height of the inclined plane becomes:
            
            \(h' = L \cdot \sin(2\theta)\)
            
            We know that \(h = h'\) (since the height remains the same).
            
            Therefore, we have:
            
            \(L \cdot \sin(\theta) = L \cdot \sin(2\theta)\)
            
            Using the trigonometric identity: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
            
            \(L \cdot \sin(\theta) = 2L \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot \cos(\theta)\)
            
            Simplifying the equation, we find:
            
            \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\)
            
            This means \(\theta = 60\) degrees.
            
            When the angle of inclination is doubled, the new angle becomes \(2\theta = 120\) degrees.
            
            The time taken for the body to reach the bottom of the inclined plane is determined by the component of gravity parallel to the inclined plane, which is \(g \cdot \sin(\theta)\).
            
            Using the equation of motion for motion along an inclined plane, we have:
            
            \(h = \frac{1}{2}g \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t^2\)
            
            Solving for \(t\), we find:
            
            \(t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g \cdot \sin(\theta)}}\)
            
            For the original angle of inclination (\(\theta = 30\) degrees):
            
            \(t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g \cdot \sin(30)}} = \sqrt{\frac{6h}{g}}\)
            
            For the doubled angle of inclination (\(\theta = 60\) degrees):
            
            \(t' = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g \cdot \sin(60)}} = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g \cdot \sqrt{3}}}\)
            
            Substituting the value of \(t
            
            \), we find:
            
            \(\frac{t'}{t} = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g \cdot \sqrt{3}}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{g}{6h}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{18}} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{6}\)
            
            Therefore, the ratio of \(t'\) to \(t\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{6}\).
            
            Since \(t = 3\) seconds, the time taken for the same process with the doubled angle of inclination is:
            
            \(t' = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{6} \cdot 3 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) seconds
            
            Approximating the value, we get:
            
            \(t' \approx 1.224\) seconds
            
            Therefore, the time taken for the same process with the doubled angle of inclination is approximately \(3\sqrt{3}\) seconds.</div>

                <div class="solution">(b) When the body slides on a smooth inclined plane, the time taken to reach the bottom depends on the length of the inclined plane and the angle of inclination.
            
            Let's assume the length of the inclined plane is \(L\) and the angle of inclination is \(\theta\).
            
            Using the equation of motion for motion along an inclined plane, we have:
            
            \(L = \frac{1}{2}g \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t^2\)
            
            Since the body starts from rest at the top, its initial velocity is 0 m/s.
            
            The distance covered by the body starting from rest at the top is one-fourth of the length of the inclined plane:
            
            \(d = \frac{1}{4}L\)
            
            Substituting the value of \(L\) from the equation of motion, we can find the time taken to cover one-fourth the distance:
            
            \(\frac{1}{4}L = \frac{1}{2}g \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot t^2\)
            
            Simplifying the equation, we find:
            
            \(t = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g \cdot \sin(\theta)}}\)
            
            Given that it takes 4 seconds to reach the bottom
            
             (\(t = 4\) seconds), we can find the value of \(\sin(\theta)\):
            
            \(4 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g \cdot \sin(\theta)}}\)
            
            Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
            
            \(16 = \frac{L}{2g \cdot \sin(\theta)}\)
            
            Simplifying the equation, we find:
            
            \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{L}{32g}\)
            
            To find the time taken to cover one-fourth the distance, we substitute the value of \(\sin(\theta)\) back into the equation:
            
            \(t = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2g \cdot \frac{L}{32g}}} = \sqrt{16} = 4\) seconds

                <div class="solution">(a) When the ball is dropped from the top of the building, it falls freely under the influence of gravity.
            
            The distance covered by the ball in the last \(\frac{1}{4}\)th time of its fall is given as 1.4 meters.
            
            Let's assume the total time of fall is \(t\) seconds.
            
            The distance covered by the ball in the last \(\frac{1}{4}\)th time can be calculated as:
            
            \(\text{{Distance}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot \left(\frac{t}{4}\right)^2\)
            
            Given that the distance is 1.4 meters, we can write the equation as:
            
            \(1.4 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot \left(\frac{t}{4}\right)^2\)
            
            Simplifying the equation, we find:
            
            \(g = \frac{20}{t^2}\)

            \(\text{{Height}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot t^2\)

            To find the height, we can use the equation of motion for projectile motion:
            
            \(\text{{Height}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g \cdot t^2\)
            
            Substituting the value of \(g\), we get:
            
            \(\text{{Height}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{54}{t^2} \cdot t^2 = 27\) meters
            
            Therefore, the height is 7.5 meters.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) The acceleration of a body released from height 'h' can be determined by the mass of the body and the height from which it is released.
            
            When a body is released from height 'h', it undergoes free fall under the influence of gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is constant and is denoted by 'g'.
            
            The acceleration of the body is given by:
            
            \(a = \frac{{g \cdot h}}{{h}}\)
            
            Since the mass of the body (m) does not affect the acceleration in free fall, the acceleration is determined by the height (h) only.</div>

                <div class="solution">(a) Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.
            
            In this case, the aeroplane travels with a velocity of 600 km/hr due east and returns with a velocity of 400 km/hr.
            
            Since they travel the same distance, the total distance covered is the same for both cases.
            
            Let's assume the total distance traveled is 'd' km.
            
            The time taken to travel with a velocity of 600 km/hr is \( \frac{d}{600} \) hours.
            
            The time taken to travel with a velocity of 400 km/hr is \( \
            
            frac{d}{400} \) hours.
            
            The total time taken is \( \frac{d}{600} + \frac{d}{400} = \frac{7d}{1200} \) hours.
            
            The average speed is given by:
            
            \( \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{7d}{1200}} = \frac{2400}{7} \) km/hr
            
            Therefore, the average speed is 240 km/hr.</div>

                <div class="solution">(c) The actual velocity of the rain can be determined by considering the relative velocities of the person and the rain.
            
            The person is traveling at 4 m/s towards the east.
            
            The rain is falling vertically downwards with a velocity of 3 m/s.
            
            To find the actual velocity of the rain, we need to consider the vector sum of the velocities of the person and the rain.
            
            Since the person is moving towards the east and the rain is falling vertically downwards, the two velocities are perpendicular to each other.
            
            We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the actual velocity of the rain:
            
            \( \text{Actual Velocity of Rain} = \sqrt{(4 \, \text{m/s})^2 + (3 \, \text{m/s})^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \)
            
            Therefore, the actual velocity of the rain is 5 m/s.</div>

            The total distance covered is 80 km (40 km + 40 km).
            
            The time taken to cover the first 40 km is \( \frac{40 \, \text{km}}{80 \, \text{km/hr}} = \frac{1}{2} \) hour.
            
            The time taken to cover the next 40 km is \( \frac{40 \, \text{km}}{40 \, \text{km/hr}} = 1 \) hour.
            
            The total time taken is \( \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = \frac{3}{2} \) hours.
