    <h1>Electrostatics and Charges</h1>

    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The study of charges at rest is called Static electricity or electrostatics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Charges are produced due to actual transfer of electrons.
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            Positive charge means the deficiency of electrons while
          </li>
          <li>
            Negative charge means excess (gain) of electrons.< <ol>
          <li>So, during charge transfer there is change in mass too.</li>
          <li>Thus, mass of -vely charged body is greater than that of +vely charged body.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>2. Properties of Charges</h1>

    <h2>a. Quantization of Charge</h2>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>q = ¬±ne, where 'n' is an integer</li>
      <li>q = ¬±1e, ¬±2e, ¬±3e, ...</li>
      <li>Charge less than e (i.e., 1.6√ó10<sup>‚àí19</sup> C) is not possible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>b. Conservation of Charge</h2>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>On an isolated system, total electric charge always remains constant.</li>
      <li>Every atom is electrically neutral as it contains as many electrons as the number of protons in it.</li>
      <li>When we rub a glass üç∏ rod with a piece of silk, the +ve charge acquired by the glass rod is equal to -ve
        charge acquired by silk piece. Thus charges are produced in equal and unlike pairs.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Charging preference</li>
        <ol>
          <li>HigherüëÜ gets ‚ûï charge while lower üëá gets ‚ûñ charge</li>
          <li>Fur</li>
          <li>Flannel</li>
          <li>Glass üç∏</li>
          <li>Cotton</li>
          <li>Paper üìÑ</li>
          <li>Silk</li>
          <li>Man üë®</li>
          <li>Wood</li>
          <li>Metal</li>
          <li>Rubber</li>
          <li>Resin</li>
          <li>Amber</li>
          <li>Sulphur</li>
          <li>Ebonite</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <li>
      Like charges repel each other while unlike charges attract.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Repulsion is the sure test of electrification.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      The magnitude of charge is not affected by its motion unlike mass i.e., charge is invariant.
    </li>
    <li>
      A charge at rest produces only electric field around itself.
      <ol type="i">
        <li>A charge having unaccelerated(uniform) motion produces electric as well as magnetic field around it.</li>
        <li>A charge having accelerated motion emits electromagnetic radiation also in addition to producing electric
          and magnetic fields.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>




    <h1>3. Charging of Body</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>A body can be charged by</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Friction</li>
        <li>Induction
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Charging a body by induction is preferable since the same charged body can be used to charge any number
              of bodies without loss of charge.</li>
            <li>If \( q \) is the inducing charge, then the charge induced on a body having dielectric constant \(
              \epsilon_r \) is given by:
              \[ q_{\text{induced}} = -q_{\text{inducing}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon_r}\right) \]
              <ol>
                <li>\( \epsilon_r \) is the dielectric constant of the uncharged body</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>For air or vacuum, \( \epsilon_r \) or \( K = 1 \), therefore \( q_{\text{induced}} =
                    -q_{\text{inducing}} (1 - 1/1) = 0 \)</li>
                  <li>For insulator, \( \epsilon_r > 1 \), therefore \( q_{\text{induced}} < -q_{\text{inducing}}
                      \)</li>
                  <li>For conductor, \( \epsilon_r = \infty \), therefore \( q_{\text{induced}} = -q_{\text{inducing}}
                    (1 - 1/\infty) = -q_{\text{inducing}} \)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Conclusion: \( q_{\text{induced}} \leq -q_{\text{inducing}} \)</li>
                <li>The negative sign indicates the opposite nature of induction</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>In the inducing process, the net induced charge on a body will be zero.</li>
            <li>In the inducing process, both the charge and mass of the charged body remain the same, but the potential
              of the charging body decreases.</li>

    <h1>5. Coulomb's Law</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>The force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of
        charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>\( F \propto \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)</li>
        <li>\( F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)</li>
        <li>\( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2 \, \text{N}^{-1} \, \text{m}^{-2} \) (Permittivity of
          free space)</li>
        <li>\( F_{\text{medium}} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon} \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0
          \epsilon_r} \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \)</li>
        <li>\( \epsilon_r = \frac{F_{\text{air}}}{F_{\text{medium}}} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} \) (Relative
          permittivity of free space or Dielectric constant of the medium)</li>

        <li>When two charges are held in air at distance \( r \), then:</li>
        <li>\( F_{\text{air}} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = 9 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{q_1
          q_2}{r^2} \)</li>
      </ol>
      <li> Coulomb's force is valid only for point charges.</li>

      <li> The magnitude of Coulomb's force at the location of two charges is always equal even if charges are equal
        or different, but acts in opposite directions (Newton's third law):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>\( F_1 = -F_2 \)</li>
      </ul>
      <li> Coulomb's force doesn't depend on the mass of charge; the magnitude of Coulomb's force at the location of
        two charges is always the same even if the masses of the charges are different.</li>
    </ol>

          <li>The ratio of forces between two small spheres with constant charge in air and in a medium of dielectric
            constant \(K\) is K:1.</li>

          <li>Divergence of gold leaf electroscope (GLE) can be used to study charge.    </li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>When the body to be tested is brought to the disc of the GLE, if the leaves of GLE don't diverge, the
                body must be uncharged and if the leaves of GLE show divergence, the body must be charged.</li>

          <li>If a soap bubble is given a small +ve or -ve charge, its radius increases because of repulsion and its
            surface tension decreases.   </li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>This is because the surface tension will balance the outward force due to the pressure difference
                between the inside and the outside air of a soap bubble. The soap bubble is expanding in order to
                minimize surface tension.</li>

            electrical induction.</li>
