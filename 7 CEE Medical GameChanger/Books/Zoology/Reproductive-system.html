      <h1> Introduction</h1>
      <ol>
        <li> Organ which secretes gamete and hormones is called primary sex organ.</li>
        <li> Remaining organs can be classified as secondary and accessory sex organs.


        <li> Primary sex organ of male is Testis which secretes male gamete (sperm) and male hormones androgens
          (mainly testosterone). Primary sex organ of female is ovary which secretes female gamete (ovum) and female
          hormones {estrogen and progesterone).</li>
        <li> The highest centre for the control of reproduction is hypothalamus.</li>
        <li> Secondary and Accessory sex organs - Fallopian tube, Uterus, Vagina, Vulva, Bartholin's gland,
          Paraurethral glands.</li>
      </ol>


      <h2>FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</h2>

      <h3>Ovary</h3>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Primary sex organ of female is ovary.</li>
        <li>Ovary is attached to the uterus by ovarian ligament and it is attached to the pelvic wall by suspensory
          ligament.</li>
        <li>The part of broad ligament of the uterus that covers the ovary is called mesovarium (peritoneum of ovary).
          It is an intraperitoneal organ.</li>
        <li>Part of ovary through which blood vessels, nerves, etc. enter is called hilum.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Outermost layer of ovary is called germinal epithelium which is made up of cuboidal (or squamous)
          epithelium.</li>
        <li>Cells that produce ova arise from the yolk sac and migrate to the ovaries during embryonic development.</li>
        <li>The tunica albuginea (fibrous protective layer) is a whitish capsule dense irregular connective tissue
          located immediately deep to the germinal epithelium.</li>
        <li>The ovarian cortex is a region just deep to the tunica albuginea. It consists of ovarian follicles
          (described shortly) surrounded by dense irregular connective tissue that contains collagen fibers and
          fibroblast-like cells called stromal cells.</li>
        <li>The ovarian medulla is deep to the ovarian cortex. The border between the cortex and medulla is indistinct,
          but the medulla consists of more loosely arranged connective tissue and contains blood vessels, lymphatic
          vessels, and nerves.</li>
        <li>Ovarian follicles are in the cortex and consist of oocytes in various stages of development plus the cells
          surrounding them. When the surrounding cells form a single layer, they are called follicular cells); later in
          development, when they form several layers, they are referred to as granulosa cells. The surrounding cells the
          developing oocyte and begin to secrete estrogens as the follicle grows larger.</li>
      </ol>


      <h4>Follicular cycle</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>The formation of gametes in the ovaries is termed oogenesis.</li>

        <li>Spermatogenesis begins in males at puberty but oogenesis begins in females before birth.</li>
        <li>
          During early fetal development, primordial (primitive) germ cells differentiate into oogonia and are
          surrounded by flat squamous cells called follicular cells. The oogonia first undergo mitosis and enter
          meiosis.

        <li>Mitosis and meiosis both are involved in the formation of gametes.</li>
        <li>Primitivities follicles present in the ovary are called primordial follicles which contain ovum arrested at
          the stage of Prophase I and the follicular cells.</li>
        <li>
          Primordial follicles change into primary follicles (15-20 in each cycle) after menarche. In primary follicles,
          the surrounding single-layered flat squamous cells change into multiple-layered columnar cells which are now
          called granulosa cells.

        <li>Germ cells migrate from the yolk sac to the ovaries.</li>
        <li>
          Primary follicle develops into a secondary follicle which contains:
          <ol>
            <li>Innermost developing oocyte</li>
            <li>Acellular zona pellucida membrane surrounding the oocyte</li>
            <li>Granulosa cells layer</li>
            <li>
              Theca cells layer derived from the stroma of the ovary and differentiated into inner theca interna and
              outer theca externa.

          </ol>

        <li>
          A cavity which appears within the granulosa cell layer is called antrum which contains fluid called liquor
          folliculi. Antrum divides this layer into an outer thin layer of granulosa cells and inner granulosa cells
          which surround the ovum. The layer of granulosa cells surrounding the ovum is called corona radiata. The cells
          that attach the oocyte to the wall of the follicle are called cumulus oophorous or discus proligerous or germ
          hill.

        <li>Secondary follicle develops a larger fluid-filled cavity and changes into the Graafian follicle.</li>
        <li>
          Mature follicle found in ovaries of human/rabbit is called Graafian follicle.

        <li>Estrogen is secreted by granulosa cells of the Graafian follicle (Androgen is secreted by theca cells which
          is converted into estrogen by granulosa cells).</li>
        <li>Estrogen is the female sex hormone.</li>
        <li>Functions of Estrogen:
          <ol>
            <li>Causes the proliferation (increased thickness) of endometrium in the uterus</li>
            <li>Helps in the negative feedback mechanism to prevent multiple ovulations</li>
            <li>Responsible for secondary sexual characteristics of female</li>
            <li>Causes the deposition of Calcium in bones (opposes the function of parathormone)</li>
            <li>Makes the cervical mucus thinner helping the penetration of sperm into the uterus.</li>
            <li>Menopause is caused due to Estrogen.</li>
          </ol>

        <li>Graafian follicle ruptures and releases the ovum at the stage of secondary oocyte which is at Metaphase II
          of cell division. This process is called Ovulation and occurs due to LH surge.</li>
        <li>FSH and LH both hormones have a role in ovulation but LH surge has a greater role.</li>
        <li>Structure formed after ovulation (rupture of graafian follicle) in the ovary is called corpus luteum.</li>
        <li>Corpus luteum secretes the following hormones:
          <ol>
            <li>Estrogen (in fewer amounts)</li>
            <li>Progesterone</li>
            <li>Relaxin - Helps to relax pelvis and uterine ligaments during delivery</li>
            <li>Inhibin - Helps in the negative feedback mechanism and inhibits the release of FSH by the anterior
              pituitary preventing multiple ovulations.</li>
          </ol>

        <li>Functions of progesterone:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Causes the development of glands and blood vessels in the endometrium and makes this layer thicker
            creating a favorable environment for the attachment of the fetus.</li>
          <li>Prevents ovulation during pregnancy.</li>
          <li>Makes the cervical mucus thicker preventing the penetration of sperm into the uterus.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>Oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is the most appropriate method of contraception for a newly married couple.
        </li>
        <li>OCPs work by Inhibiting Ovulation.</li>
        <li>Preventing fertilization due to atrophy or hypertrophy of the endometrium.</li>
        <li>Formation of a thick cervical mucus plug which prevents the entry of sperm.</li>
        <li>Progesterone hormone is also called the hormone of Pregnancy and it helps during embryogenesis.</li>
        <li>
          "If the ovum is fertilized, the zygote formed is carried to the uterus and implantation occurs at the
          posterior fundus of the uterus. Implantation occurs at the Blastocyst stage at around day 6-7 and the placenta
          is developed. Placenta secretes Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) which maintains the corpus luteum after
          pregnancy.

        <li>
          The corpus luteum continues secreting progesterone maintaining pregnancy. HCG is used in Urine Pregnancy Test
          (UPT).

        <li>
          If the ovum is not fertilized, the ovum dies after 24 hours and is carried to the uterus. Corpus luteum starts
          degenerating and changes into corpus albicans and the production of progesterone is stopped. This leads to the
          degeneration of the stratum functionalis layer of the endometrium and it is shed off along with the dead egg.
          This is called Menstruation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>MENSTRUAL CYCLE</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Start of menstruation is called Menarche and stoppage is called Menopause.</li>
        <li>
          Menstruation occurs every 28 days (21-35 days).</li>
        <ol>
          <li>1st to 4th day: Menstrual or Bleeding phase</li>
          <li>
            5th to 14th day: Follicular/ Proliferative/ Pre-ovulatery/ Estrogen Phase.
            <p>The changes occurring in ovaries (development of follicles from primary to graafian) and uterus
              (proliferation of endometrium under the influence of estrogen) before ovulation that were discussed in the
              follicular cycle occur during this phase.</p>
          </li>
          <li>4th day: Ovulation</li>
          <li>
            15th to 28th day: Luteal/ Secretory/ Postovulatory/ Progesterone Phase.
            <p>The changes occurring in ovaries (formation of corpus luteum) and uterus (secretory changes due to glands
              developed by progesterone in endometrium) after ovulation that were discussed in the follicular cycle
              occur during this phase.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <li>Estrogen rises to peak level on the 12th day of the menstrual cycle and progesterone rises to peak level on
          the 21st day of the cycle.</li>
        <li>
          Safe period: 1st day of menstruation +/- 7 days.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>ESTROUS CYCLE</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Occurs in Non-Primates only during the breeding season.</li>
        <li>Menstruation doesn't occur.</li>
        <li>
          Estrogen level rises during this phase and causes increased sexual desire. This period is called the 'Period
          of Heat'.
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Monoestrous animals: only one cycle in the breeding season.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>E.g. Dog, fox, deer, bat, etc.</li>
          </ol>

          <li>
            Polyestrous animals: More than one cycle in the breeding season.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>E.g. Mouse, pig, squirrel, cat, etc.</li>
          </ol>

        <li>The epithelial cells contain glycogen (from puberty to menopause) which shows cyclic changes. Bacteria
          Lactobacillus acidophilus or Doderlein's bacillus bring about fermentation and produce Lactic acid which
          inhibits growth of other microorganisms and is responsible for the acidic environment in the vagina (PH =
          4-4.5).</li>
        <li>The opening of the vagina is called vaginal orifice (vaginal opening). It is partially covered in a virgin
          girl by a thin membrane called the hymen (but it cannot be considered as a test of virginity), the hymen is
          normally ruptured during a female's first copulation.</li>

      <li> Spermatogonia or Spermatogenic cells - develop into sperm</li>
      <li> Sertoli/ somatic/ nursing/ supporting/ sustentacular cells - provide nourishment to the sperms, function controlled by FSH.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Leydig/interstitial cells are found in between seminiferous tubules - secrete male hormone Testosterone, under the stimulation of Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone (ICSH) or LH.
  </li>
  <li>
    Functions of testosterone
    <ul>
      <li>Plays a key role in the development of male reproductive issues such as the testis and prostate and also causes the maturation of the sex organs particularly the penis and scrotum.</li>
      <li>Secondary sexual characteristics in males like increased muscle, bone mass, growth of body hair etc.</li>
      <li>Necessary for normal sperm development</li>
      <li>Testosterone is an anabolic steroid hormone as it causes the growth of muscles, bone density, and strength.</li>
      <li>Other androgens in males: liDihydrotestosterone (DHT), liandrostenedione, liDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) etc.</li>
      <li>Rete (network) testis is a part of the seminiferous tubule and lined by cuboidal epithelium.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Orchidectomy is the surgical removal of the testis, it is also known as castration.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Secondary Sex Organs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Scrotum, Epididymis, Vas deferens, Seminal vesicle, Ejaculatory duct, Prostate, Urethra, Penis are Secondary sex organs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scrotum</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Dartos muscle is present in scrotum.
	</li>
	<li>
		Spermatic cord connects testis with abdominal cavity and passes through inguinal canal. It consists of an artery, a vein, a lymph vessel, a nerve, cremaster muscle and a vas deferens.
	</li>
	<li>
		Descent of testes in scrotum provides suitable temperature (2-3 degree Celsius lower than the abdominal cavity) for maintenance of spermatogenic tissue and formation of sperms (Spermatogenesis). Failure of testes to descend in scrotum is cryptorchidism.
	</li>
	<li>
		Abdominal testes are present in Whale and Elephant.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3> Vas efferentia</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Rete testis is connected to caput epididymis by 12 - 20 fine tubules called vasa efferentia or ductull efferentes. Their lining epithelium is ciliated for conducting sperms.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epididymis</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		On the inner wall of the testis, a highly coiled tubule is present called the epididymis, 3m in rabbit and 6 m in human.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sperm gains motility in the epididymis but it has no secretion of its own.
	</li>
	<li>
		Parts:
		<ul>
			<li> Upper part (Head) called caput epididymis or globus major - connects epididymis to testis</li>
			<li> Middle part called corpus epididymis or globus normal</li>
			<li>Basal part (Tail) called cauda epididymis or globus minor - connects epididymis to vas deferens</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3> Vasa deferential (Singular-vas deferens)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		The vas deferens is a continuation of the cauda epididymis. It is about 45 cm long and is slightly coiled at first but becomes straight as it enters the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal. Here, it passes over the urinary bladder, curves around the ureter and joins the duct of a seminal vesicle to form an ejaculatory duct. Near its end, the vas deferens is enlarged to form a spindle-like ampulla for the temporary storage of spermatozoa. At its distal end, the ampulla receives a duct from the seminal vesicle.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lined by ciliated columnar epithelium
	</li>
	<li>
		Homologous with labia minora of female
	</li>
	<li>
		Surgical ligation of the vas deferens is called vasectomy. It is the permanent method of family planning for males.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3> Seminal vesicle (Uterus masculinus)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Its secretion constitutes about 60% of semen which contains spermatozoa activating substances, such as fructose, citrate, inositol, prostaglandins, and several proteins.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fructose is required for the nutrition of sperms.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fructose test is used as a forensic test for Rape.
	</li>
	<li>
		Developed from the mullerian duct of the embryo
	</li>
</ul>



<h3> Prostate gland</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Located at the base of the urinary bladder with apex directed downwards and base upwards
	</li>
	<li>
		This gland secretes an acidic fluid (due to citric acid) which forms 15 - 30% part of the semen. The secretion nourishes and activates the spermatozoa to swim. It is essential for sperm motility (removal causes sterility)
	</li>
	<li>
		Homologous with Skene's gland in females
	</li>
</ul>

<h3> Cowper's glands/ Bulbourethral gland</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Cowper's glands are present in male mammals.
	</li>
	<li>
		These are also termed as bulbourethral glands.
	</li>
	<li>
		They secrete alkaline mucus which acts as a lubricant during sexual intercourse and it also neutralizes the acidic urethra after micturition.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Perineal and Rectal glands</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Absent in humans
	</li>
	<li>
		Present in both male and female rabbits, perineal glands/rectal glands are found around external genital organs, perineum, and anus.
	</li>
	<li>
		During the breeding season, these glands secrete odoriferous liquid which has pheromones or ectohormones in it, which develops sexual attraction between opposite sexes and also develops the desire for copulation.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>PENIS</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Erectile male copulatory organ homologous to the clitoris of females.
	</li>
	<li>
		Made up of 3 erectile muscular tissues:
		<ul>
			<li>Corpus spongiosum (1) - urethra passes through it</li>
			<li> Corpora cavernosa (2)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Anterior enlarged part is called glans penis.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fold of skin covering the glans penis is called foreskin or prepuce.
	</li>
	<li>
		Surgical removal of the foreskin is called circumcision.
	</li>
	<li>
		Circumcision is thought to minimize the risk of Urinary tract infection (UTI), HIV, and penile cancer (as it prevents the collection of smegma secreted by prepucial glands or glands of Tyson which is a carcinogen).
	</li>
	<li>
		Parasympathetic action causes Erection and sympathetic action causes Ejaculation (Shoot).
	</li>
	<li>
		Erection of the penis is due to the vasodilation (due to nitric oxide) of the arteries of the penis which stimulates the erectile tissues and obstructs the veins at the periphery of the penis.
	</li>
	<li>
		Viagra (Sildenafil citrate) is a drug used for impotency (inability to make the penis erect).
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>GAMETOGENESIS</h1>
    <ul>

      <li>Germ cells = cuboidal epithelium.</li>
      
      <li>Gametogenesis is controlled by gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH, ICSH, etc, primarily FSH) secreted by pituitary gland.</li>
      
      <li>1 primary spermatocyte = 4 sperm, 1 secondary spermatocyte = 2 sperm [BPKIHS 2010]</li>
      
      <li>1 primary oocyte = 1 ovum and 3 polar bodies, 1 secondary oocyte = 1 ovum and 1 polar body [BPKIHS 2007]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>SPERMATOGENESIS</h2>
    <ul>
        
            <li> Spermatogenesis occurs in seminiferous tubules of testes (takes about 74 days for completion).</li>
            <li> Spermatids are formed after three phases:</li>
            <li>Phase of multiplication (mitosis):</li>
            <p>During phase of multiplication, the primordial germ cells divide repeatedly by mitosis to form diploid spermatogonia. Each spermatogonium divides mitotically to form two primary spermatocytes.</p>
            <li>Phase of growth:</li>
            <p>During phase of growth, the primary spermatocyte enlarges in size and prepares to undergo maturation division.</p>
            <li>Phase of maturation (meiosis):</li>
            <p>During phase of maturation, the primary spermatocyte undergoes meiosis-l giving rise to two haploid secondary spermatocytes.</p>
            <li>The secondary spermatocytes undergo meiosis-II resulting in the formation of four spermatids.</li>
            <li>A spermatid is non-motile and heavy. It has organelles like mitochondria, golgi bodies, centrioles, nucleus etc.</li>
            <li>Metamorphosis of spermatid to spermatozoa is termed spermiogenesis (it also occurs in seminiferous tubules).</li>
            <li>Following changes are seen during spermiogenesis:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of cytoplasm</li>
                <li>Development of acrosome from golgi bodies</li>
                <li>Development of tail</li>
                <li>Narrowing of nucleus</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Liberation of sperm from Sertoli cells into lumen of seminiferous tubules is called spermiation.</li>
            <li>Liberation of sperm from testis is called semination.</li>
            <li>Liberation of sperm from body of male is called ejaculation.</li>
            <li>Transfer of sperm into the female's reproductive tract is called insemination.</li>
            <li>The process by which sperm develops capacity to fertilize ovum is called capacitation. [BPKIHS 2012] It occurs in female reproductive tract (fallopian tube).</li>
            <h3>Structure of Sperm</h3>
            <p>The human sperm was first seen by Hamm and Leeuwenhoek.</p>
            <p>Sperms remain alive and retain their ability to fertilize an ovum from 24 to 48 hours after being released in the female tract.</p>
            <p>A typical mammalian sperm consists: Head, Neck, Middle piece or Body, Tail or Flagellum</p>
            <h4>Head (Acrosome and nucleus):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The head is covered by a cap-like structure called acrosome or anterior nuclear cap or galea capitis with hydrolytic enzyme (sperm lysin called Hyaluronicase, which is used to penetrate the egg (by digesting hyaluronic acid present in corona radiata) at the time of fertilization. Hyaluronicase is synthesized by Golgi apparatus of acrosome.</li>
                <li>If acrosome is removed from a sperm, it will fail to penetrate the ovum.</li>
                <li>Nuclear part of head of spermatozoa consists of chromatin (mostly DNA) that is extremely condensed and contains a basic protein called Protamin.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Neck:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contains the proximal centriole toward the nucleus, help in the first cleavage of the zygote and the distal centriole - gives rise to the axial filament of the sperm.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Middle piece or Body (Mitochondria):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The middle piece of human sperm contains mitochondria which are coiled around the axial filament forming a spiral sheath called Nebenkern sheath.</li>
                <li>Cytoplasm around the mitochondria is called Manchette.</li>
                <li>It is also called energy chamber or powerhouse of sperm. [BPKIHS 2009]</li>
                <li>At the end of middle piece, ring centriole (annulus) is present with unknown function.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Tail (flagellum):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Its major part is called main piece and small part behind it is called end piece.</li>
                <li>The sperms swim in a fluid medium by its tail or flagellum (flagellar movement). [BP 2004]</li>
                <li>The part of sperm entering and penetrating the ovum is head and neck.</li>
                <li>Motility of sperm is due to head and middle piece both.</li>
            </ul>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Oogonesis</h2>
   
        
            <h3>It includes:</h3>
            <p>Multiplication phase:</p>
            <p>Primordial cells in the ovary divide mitotically to form Oogonia (egg mother cell). Each oogonium divides mitotically to form two primary oocytes.</p>
            <p>Growth phase:</p>
            <p>Primary oocyte increases in size. This is comparatively longer phase.</p>
            <p>Maturation phase</p>
            <p>Primary oocyte (2n) undergoes meiosis-I producing two haploid cells (n). Larger one is secondary oocyte and smaller one is first polar body.</p>
            <p>Meiosis-II of secondary oocyte results in the formation of ovum or egg and second polar body.</p>
            <p>In oogenesis, only one of the four products of meiosis becomes a functional egg. Rest three are polar bodies-nonfunctional.</p>
            <p>Vitellogenesis is the formation and deposition of yolk in the egg.</p>
            <p>Major chemical components of yolk are phospholipids and proteins. Least amount of substance found in yolk is carbohydrate.</p>
            <h3>Types of ovum (egg) on the basis of amount of yolk</h3>
            <p> Alecithal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of yolk is negligible.</li>
                <li>E.g. Human egg</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Microlecithal or Oligolecithal eggs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of yolk is very less.</li>
                <li>E.g. Amphioxus, Placental mammals (Rabbit), Metatheria and sea urchin</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Mesolecithal eggs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of yolk is moderate.</li>
                <li>E.g. Amphibia, Petromyzon and lung tis</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Polylecithal or macrolecithal or megalecithal eggs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount of yolk is large. E.g. Insect, Bird, Reptiles etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: If the question is asked for both human and rabbit, choose microlecithal.</p>
            <h3>Structure of Ovum:</h3>
            <ol>

              <li>The mature ovum of female is spherical in nature (Long and cylindrical eggs are present in insects)</li>
              <li>oocytoplasm is called ooplasm with nucleus called germinal vesicle and the nucleus has a prominent nucleolus called germinal spot.</li>
              <li>The cytoplasm is enveloped by cell membrane or plasma membrane around which thin vitelline membrane is present. This acellular membrane is called Zona pullucida in mammals.</li>
              <li>Around the zona pellucida, very thick, cellular corona radiata, formed by radially elongated follicular cells is present.</li>
              <li>A narrow perivitelline space is present between the zona pellucida and plasma membrane.</li>
              <li>The side of the ovum with polar body is called animal pole.</li>
              <li>human ovum loses its ability to be fertilized after about 24 hours after ovulation.</li>
            </ol>
