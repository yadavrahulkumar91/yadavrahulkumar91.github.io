      <h1>Embryology and Development</h1>
      <h2>1. Implantation</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>After the 32-cell stage.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The study of development of an organism is called <em>Embryology</em> or <em>Developmental biology</em>.</li>
          <li><em>Embryology</em> deals with developmental changes from zygote to death.</li>
          <li>The entire process of development is called <em>embryogenesis</em> or <em>ontogenesis</em>.</li>
          <li>Aristotle is regarded as the founder of the science of embryology.</li>
          <li>The father of Modern Embryology is Karl Ernst Von Baer.</li>
          <li>The development of a new individual from an asexual reproductive body is called <em>blastogenesis</em>.</li>
          <li>The development of a new individual from the fertilized egg or zygote is called <em>embryogenesis</em>.</li>
          <li>Formation of the complete body from the zygote is <em>development</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Development includes three basic processes:</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>i. Proliferation of cells by cell growth and division.</li>
                  <li>ii. Differentiation of the cells into various types according to division of labour by gene suppression.</li>
                  <li>iii. Arrangement of differentiated cells into tissue and tissues into organs.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Paedogamy</em> is the sexual reproduction of animals in larval condition.</li>
          <li><em>Gametes</em> are mature reproductive cells. The gametes of two sexes fuse giving rise to <em>zygote</em>. The gametes are produced in gonads by <em>gametogenesis</em>.</li>
          <li>The study of abnormal embryonic development is termed <em>Teratology</em>.</li>
          <li><em>Oviparous</em>: These are egg-laying animals in which most of the embryonic development of fertilized egg occurs outside the body of the mother, e.g., Insects, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, etc.</li>
          <li><em>Ovoviviparous</em>: These are egg-laying animals in which the egg develops inside the maternal body but is not supplied with the maternal nourishment.</li>
          <li><em>Viviparous</em>: These are the animals in which the ova become implanted in the uterine wall after fertilization and develop there until birth. E.g., Eutherian mammals.
              <ul>
                  <li><em>Viviparity</em> is also found in some elasmobranch fishes and reptiles.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li><em>Parthenogenesis</em> (virgin birth or virginal reproduction): Development of an egg into a complete individual without fertilization by a sperm or parthenogenesis.
              <ul>
                  <li><em>Lacerta saxicola</em> of Russia show natural parthenogenesis.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>

          <li><strong>3. Fertilization</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>a. Fertilization is a complex physio-chemical process which involves the fusion of a male gamete and a female gamete.</li>
                  <li>b. There are two types of fertilization.
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. External fertilization occurs in oviparous animals which lay eggs in water. E.g., Frog.</li>
                          <li>ii. Internal fertilization occurs in ovoviviparous or viviparous animals. E.g., Echidna, rabbit, and man.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>c. Fertilizin-antifertilizin reaction
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Fertilizins are the substances emitted from mature eggs.
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1) Fertilizins are present on the surface of the egg.</li>
                                  <li>2) Chemically, fertilizin is a glycoprotein or mucopolysaccharide.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>ii. Antilfertilizin is present on the surface layer of the cytoplasm of spermatozoa.
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1) Chemically, antifertilizin is an acidic protein molecule.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>iii. During fertilization, the fertilizin and antifertilizin combine in a specific way causing 'fertilizin-antifertilizin reaction'.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>d. Place of fertilization
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Fertilization in birds generally takes place when the egg is in the oviduct.</li>
                          <li>ii. In mammals (rabbit and man), fertilization of the ovum occurs in the fallopian tube.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>e. The egg of insects has a protective wall chorion. The spermatozoa enter the egg through the micropyles.</li>
                  <li>f. Sperm penetrates through the egg wall in most of the organisms by the help of sperm lysins formed from the acrosome.</li>
                  <li>g. When the acrosome of the spermatozoa touches the surface of the egg, the cytoplasm of the egg bulges forward forming receptive cone or fertilization cone.</li>
                  <li>h. Immediately after fertilization, a new membrane namely fertilization membrane develops outside the vitelline membrane.</li>
                  <li>i. The entrance of late arriving sperms in the ovum is blocked by the fertilization membrane.
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Fertilization membrane prevents polyspermic fertilization by preventing further entry of spermatozoa.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>j. In vertebrates (man, rabbit, and frog), the egg completes its first reduction division in the ovary and reaches the metaphase stage of the second meiotic division (Metaphase -II). The second oocyte is formed before fertilization.</li>
                  <li>k. The second division is completed and the second polar body is extruded only if the egg is fertilized by a spermatozoon.</li>
                  <li>l. The fusion of male and female pronuclei is called amphimixis (syngamy).
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Male and female pronuclei are haploid. Amphimixis results in the formation of a diploid zygote nucleus.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>m. In all animals, the fertilized ovum develops in the sequence:
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Zygote</li>
                          <li>ii. Cleavage</li>
                          <li>iii. Morula</li>
                          <li>iv. Blastula</li>

                          <li>vi. Neurula</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      
          <li><strong>4. Cleavage</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>a. Development of a fertilized egg starts with cleavage.</li>
                  <li>b. Cleavage is a process of rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote.</li>
                  <li>c. Cleavage differs from ordinary mitosis in the following respects.
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Cleavage occurs in all cells whereas mitosis doesn't.</li>
                          <li>ii. Interphase is short and does not involve growth.</li>
                          <li>iii. Divisions are very rapid with rapid DNA replication. Nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio increases with each division.</li>
                          <li>iv. There is a decrease in the size of blastomeres; size and shape of the embryo do not change.</li>
                          <li>v. High consumption of oxygen. The metabolism becomes fast.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>d. Patterns of Cleavages
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Radial
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1) All blastomeres are placed in a radially symmetrical manner around the animal-vegetal axis.</li>
                                  <li>2) E.g., Sponges, Coelenterates, and some echinoderms.</li>
                                  <li>3) Biradial cleavage</li>

                                  <li>1) Blastomeres are arranged in a spiral manner.</li>
                                  <li>2) E.g., Platyhelminthes, Annelids, and most mollusks.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>iii. Bilateral cleavage:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1) Blastomeres are arranged so that right and left sides become apparent.</li>
                                  <li>2) E.g., Amphibians and higher mammals.</li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>e. Types of Cleavage
                      <ul>
                          <li>i. Types of Cleavage are influenced by the amount and distribution of yolk.</li>
                          <li>ii. Following basic types of cleavages are found in animals.
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1) Total or Holoblastic cleavage:
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>a) Cleavage furrow bisects the entire egg. Two types of Holoblastic cleavages are:</li>
                                          <li>b) Equal holoblastic cleavage:</li>
                                          <li>i) Occurs in microlecithal or isolecithal types of eggs. This produces blastomeres of equal or approximately equal size.</li>
                                          <li>ii) E.g., Starfish, Amphioxus, marsupials and placental mammals like rabbit and man.</li>
                                          <li>c) Unequal holoblastic cleavage:</li>
                                          <li>i) Occurs in mesolecithal or telolecithal type of eggs. This produces unequal-sized blastomeres called micromeres and macromeres.</li>
                                          <li>ii) E.g., Amphibians (frog)</li>
                                      </ul>
                                  </li>
                                  <li>2) Meroblastic cleavage:
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>a) This is also called partial or incomplete cleavage, occurs in macrolecithal (polylecithal) eggs which are either telolecithal or centrolecithal. Two types of meroblastic cleavages are:</li>
                                          <li>b) Discoidal cleavage:</li>

          <h2>i. Morula</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>A solid ball of cells showing resemblance with a mulberry is formed by the cleavage of a zygote. This is known as 'morula'.</li>
              <li>A morula can be differentiated from the blastula by the absence of a cavity.</li>

          <ol>
              <li>Gastrula is formed by a process called gastrulation.</li>
              <li>
                  Gastrulation is the process of embryonic development during which cell movements establish the three primary germinal layers namely:
                  <ol>
                      <li>Ectoderm</li>
                      <li>Mesoderm</li>

              </li>
              <li>During gastrulation, the cells move to occupy their definite position.</li>
              <li>Gastrulation is a process of migration and rearrangement of cells already present in the blastula.</li>
              <li>
                  New cavity formed during gastrulation is archenteron (gastrocoel) opened outside through blastopore.

                      <li>Blastopore is absent in amniotes.</li>
                      <li>In Protostomia (including Annelida, Mollusca, and Arthropoda) blastopore becomes subdivided into two openings, one of which becomes the mouth and the other the anus.</li>
                      <li>In Deuterostomia (including Echinodermata and Chordata – frog, rabbit, and man) blastopore develops into the future anus.</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Archenteron is lined with endodermal cells.</li>
              <li>
                  The movement of cells during gastrulation is called formative or morphogenetic movements.
                  <ol>
                      <li>Such movements include epiboly and emboly.</li>
                      <li>Epiboly is the growth of one part over another like prospective ectoderm over the rest except blastopore.</li>
                      <li>Emboly includes morphogenetic movements like migration of ectoderm, mesoderm, and notochord cells from the surface to the interior.

      <h1>Development and Reproduction in Frogs</h1>
      <h2>1. Breeding</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Frog breeds in the rainy season, June to September.</li>
          <li>b. Frog breeds in water like other amphibians.</li>
          <li>c. Male frogs produce croaking sounds (mating call) with their vocal sacs.</li>
          <li>d. The sexual embrace of male and female frogs is called amplexus (false copulation).</li>
          <li>e. The purpose of amplexus is to ensure simultaneous discharge of male and female gametes at the same place in water.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Ovulation</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Ovulation is the release of eggs from the ovary into the body cavity.</li>
          <li>b. Eggs in the stage of secondary oocytes are released into the body cavity by ovary rupture during ovulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Spawning</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Spawning is the act of laying eggs by the female frog, stimulated by the male during amplexus.</li>
          <li>b. Spawn is a cluster or mass of eggs laid by a female.</li>
          <li>c. Each egg is surrounded by a thin vitelline membrane and three layers of jelly coats made of gelatin.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>i. Gelatin protects the egg from predators and acts as an insulator, keeping the egg warm.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Structure of Egg</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Frog’s egg is mesolecithal (based on yolk amount) and telolecithal (based on yolk distribution).</li>
          <li>b. Upper black or darkly pigmented part is the animal hemisphere. Lower unpigmented or white part is the vegetal hemisphere.</li>
          <li>c. Cytoplasm is concentrated in the animal pole.</li>
          <li>d. Vegetal hemisphere of frog’s egg contains yolk, remaining directed downwards.</li>
          <li>e. Correct sequence in frog's development:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>i. Fertilization</li>
              <li>ii. Cleavage</li>
              <li>iii. Morula</li>
              <li>iv. Blastula</li>
              <li>v. Gastrula</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>5. Fertilization</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Fertilization in frog is external and takes place in water.</li>
          <li>b. Sperms are released on the egg mass before it reaches water.</li>
          <li>c. Sperm entry triggers the second meiotic division in the egg.</li>
          <li>d. A sperm enters the egg in the animal hemisphere.</li>
          <li>e. A gray crescent appears opposite to the sperm entrance, marking the future embryo's dorsal side.</li>
          <li>f. Sperm entry point marks the embryo's anterior side, establishing bilateral organization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>6. Cleavage</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Cleavage is the early mitotic cell divisions of the zygote until the blastula stage.</li>
          <li>b. Frog has regulative development with indeterminate cleavage.</li>
          <li>c. Stages of Cleavage:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>i. 1st Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) First cleavage is meridional, holoblastic, and equal.</li>
                  <li>2) First cleavage results in two blastomeres.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>ii. 2nd Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) Second cleavage is holoblastic and equal.</li>
                  <li>2) 4 cells are formed after the 2nd cleavage.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>iii. 3rd Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) Third cleavage is holoblastic and unequal.</li>
                  <li>2) Third cleavage results in embryo with 8 blastomeres.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>iv. 4th Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) Fourth cleavage involves two synchronous meridional divisions resulting in 16 blastomeres.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>v. 5th Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) Fifth cleavage involves two simultaneous latitudinal divisions resulting in 32 blastomeres.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>vi. 6th Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) The division after the 5th cleavage becomes irregular and asynchronous.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>vii. 7th Cleavage:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) After the 6th or 7th cleavage, the embryo looks like a morula stage.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>viii. Morula:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) Morula is a solid ball of cells.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>ix. Blastula:</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1) A cavity called blastocoel appears towards the animal hemisphere. This blastula of frog is called Coeloblastula.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>7. Gastrula</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Gastrulation converts a blastula into a gastrula with three layers:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>i. Ectoderm</li>
              <li>ii. Mesoderm</li>
              <li>iii. Endoderm enclosing an archenteron.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>b. Gastrulation includes epiboly of ectoderm, invagination of endoderm, and involution of chordamesoderm.</li>
          <li>c. Gastrulation results in archenteron and blastopore formation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>8. Neurula</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Neurulation forms a neural tube, notochord, and gut.</li>
          <li>b. Notochord formation is known as notogenesis.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>9. Metamorphosis of Tadpole to Adult Frog</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>a. Thyroxin hormone from thyroid gland triggers tadpole metamorphosis.</li>
          <li>b. Metamorphosis is delayed by food abundance and favored by food deficiency.</li>
          <li>c. Changes during metamorphosis:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>i. Tadpole stops feeding and relies on tail storage.</li>
              <li>ii. Tail becomes shorter.</li>
              <li>iii. Larval epidermis and jaws are lost.</li>
              <li>iv. Skin glands develop.</li>
              <li>v. Lungs become functional and gill clefts close.</li>
              <li>vi. Blood vascular system modifies.</li>
              <li>vii. True jaws form.</li>
              <li>viii. Eyes move to the top of the head.</li>
              <li>ix. Tongue enlarges, intestine shortens, and stomach and liver enlarge.</li>
              <li>x. Forelimbs develop, young frog leaves water.</li>
              <li>xi. Frog feeds, grows rapidly, and loses the small tail.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
