        <h2>2.1 Dalton's Atomic Theory and Its Postulates</h2>
  <p>
    Dalton's atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in the early 19th century, is the foundation of modern atomic theory. It consists of several postulates, which are as follows:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Postulate 1:</strong> Elements are composed of indivisible particles called atoms. Atoms of the same element are identical, and atoms of different elements are different.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Postulate 2:</strong> Atoms combine in simple whole number ratios to form compounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Postulate 3:</strong> Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Postulate 4:</strong> Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>2.2 Laws of Stoichiometry</h2>
  <p>
    Stoichiometry is the study of the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Several fundamental laws govern stoichiometry, including the following:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Law of Conservation of Mass:</strong> The total mass of the products of a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of the reactants. In other words, mass is conserved during a chemical reaction.
      <br><br>
      <em>Example:</em> Consider the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O):
      <br>
      H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ H<sub>2</sub>O
      <br>
      According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the reactants must be equal to the total mass of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the product. The mass is conserved throughout the reaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Law of Definite Proportions:</strong> A chemical compound always contains the same elements in the same fixed proportions by mass.
      <br><br>
      <em>Example:</em> Consider carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) composed of carbon and oxygen. According to the Law of Definite Proportions, the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen in carbon dioxide will always be constant. For every 12 grams of carbon, there will be 32 grams of oxygen in CO<sub>2</sub>.
      <br>
      The formula for the Law of Definite Proportions is:
      <br>
      Mass of element A / Mass of element B = Constant
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Law of Multiple Proportions:</strong> When two elements combine to form different compounds, the mass ratios of the second element that combine with a fixed mass of the first element can be expressed as small whole numbers.
      <br><br>
      <em>Example:</em> Consider the combination of carbon and oxygen to form two different compounds, carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The mass ratio of oxygen that combines with a fixed mass of carbon in both compounds is 1:2. This ratio can be expressed as a small whole number (2).
      <br>
      The formula for the Law of Multiple Proportions is:
      <br>
      Mass of element B in Compound 1 / Mass of element B in Compound 2 = Small whole number
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    These laws provide the foundation for stoichiometric calculations, allowing chemists to predict and quantify the amounts of substances involved in chemical
    </p>


  <h2>2.3 Avogadro's Law and Some Deductions</h2>
  <p>
    Avogadro's Law states that equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain an equal number of molecules. This law allows us to make deductions about the relationships between the volume of a gas, the number of moles, and the number of particles present.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3.1 Molecular Mass and Vapour Density</h3>
  <p>
    The molecular mass of a substance is the mass of one molecule of that substance relative to 1/12th the mass of one atom of carbon-12. It is expressed in atomic mass units (u).
  </p>

  <p>
    Vapour density is the ratio of the density of a gas to the density of hydrogen gas at the same temperature and pressure. It is a useful concept for determining the molecular mass of a gas.
  </p>

  <p>
    To calculate the molecular mass of a gas using the concept of vapour density, we can follow these steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Measure the vapour density of the gas using appropriate experimental techniques.
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine the molar mass of hydrogen gas (2.016 g/mol).
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the equation:
      <br>
      Molecular Mass = 2 x Vapour Density x Molar Mass of Hydrogen
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation of molecular mass and vapour density:
  </p>

  <p>
    If the vapour density of a gas is found to be 20, we can calculate its molecular mass as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    Molecular Mass = 2 x Vapour Density x Molar Mass of Hydrogen
    <br>
    Molecular Mass = 2 x 20 x 2.016 g/mol (molar mass of hydrogen)
    <br>
    Molecular Mass = 80.64 g/mol
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, the molecular mass of the gas is 80.64 g/mol.
  </p>

  <h2>2.4 Mole and Its Relation with Mass, Volume, and Number of Particles</h2>
  <p>
    The mole is a fundamental concept in chemistry that allows us to connect the macroscopic properties of substances, such as mass and volume, with the microscopic level represented by the number of particles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relation between mole, mass, volume, and the number of particles can be summarized as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles, which is approximately 6.022 x 10^23.
    </li>
    <li>
      The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance and is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).
    </li>
    <li>
      The molar volume of a gas is the volume occupied by one mole of that gas under standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is approximately 22.4 liters per mole (L/mol).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2.5 Calculations Based on the Mole Concept</h2>
  <p>
    The mole concept is essential for performing various calculations in chemistry, including determining the number of moles, mass, volume, or number of particles involved in a chemical reaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following formulas and relationships are commonly used in mole concept calculations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Number of Moles (n) = Mass (m) / Molar Mass (M)
    </li>
    <li>
      Number of Particles (N) = Number of Moles (n) x Avogadro's Number
    </li>
    <li>
      Volume of a Gas (V) = Number of Moles (n) x Molar Volume (Vm)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These equations allow us to convert between mass, volume, number of moles, and number of particles of a substance, enabling us to perform stoichiometric calculations and determine the quantities involved in a chemical reaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's consider an example to illustrate calculations based on the mole concept:
  </p>

  <p>
    Example: Calculation of Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles
    <br>
    If we have 25 grams of water (H2O), we can calculate the number of moles and the number of water molecules using the formulas:
  </p>

  <p>
    Number of Moles (n) = Mass (m) / Molar Mass (M)
    <br>
    Number of Particles (N) = Number of Moles (n) x Avogadro's Number
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, if we want to determine the volume of oxygen gas (O2) produced when 2 moles of potassium chlorate (KClO3) decompose, we can use the equation:
  </p>

  <p>
    Volume of Gas (V) = Number of Moles (n) x Molar Volume (Vm)
  </p>

  <p>
    These calculations based on the mole concept help us understand the relationships between mass, volume, number of particles, and moles, facilitating stoichiometric calculations in chemistry.
  </p>


  <h2>2.6 Limiting Reactant and Excess Reactant</h2>
  <p>
    In a chemical reaction, the limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed, limiting the amount of product that can be formed. The excess reactant is the reactant that is not completely consumed and remains present in excess after the reaction is complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of limiting reactant and excess reactant can be understood by comparing the stoichiometric ratios of the reactants involved in a balanced chemical equation. The reactant that produces the least amount of product, based on the stoichiometry, is the limiting reactant.
  </p>

  <p>
    To determine the limiting reactant and the amount of product formed, we can use the following steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Write and balance the chemical equation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convert the given quantities of reactants to the number of moles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine the mole ratio between the reactants based on the balanced equation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratios.
    </li>
    <li>
      Calculate the amount of product formed using the limiting reactant.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2.7 Theoretical Yield, Experimental Yield, and Percentage Yield</h2>
  <p>
    The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be formed in a chemical reaction, based on the stoichiometry and assuming complete reaction and perfect conditions. The experimental yield, on the other hand, is the actual amount of product obtained from a reaction in the laboratory.
  </p>

  <p>
    The percentage yield represents the efficiency of a reaction and is calculated by dividing the experimental yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100%:
  </p>

  <p>
    Percentage Yield = (Experimental Yield / Theoretical Yield) x 100%
  </p>

  <p>
    A percentage yield of 100% indicates that the experimental yield matches the theoretical yield, while a percentage yield less than 100% suggests that some factors, such as side reactions or incomplete reactions, are affecting the efficiency of the process.

  <h2>2.8 Calculation of Empirical and Molecular Formula from % Composition (Solving Related Numerical Problems)</h2>
  <p>
    The empirical formula of a compound represents the simplest ratio of the atoms present in the compound. The molecular formula, on the other hand, provides the actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule.
  </p>

  <p>
    The empirical formula can be determined from the percentage composition of a compound. To calculate the empirical formula, we follow these steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Assume a sample size of 100 grams for the compound.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convert the percentage composition to grams for each element.
    </li>
    <li>
      Convert the grams of each element to moles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine the simplest mole ratio of the elements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write the empirical formula using the mole ratios.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The molecular formula can be determined from the empirical formula and the molar mass of the compound. The molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula, where the multiple is the ratio of the molar mass to the empirical formula mass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation of empirical and molecular formulas from the percentage composition:
  </p>

  <p>
    Example: Calculation of Empirical and Molecular Formula
    <br>
    If a compound contains 54.5% carbon, 9.1% hydrogen, and 36.4% oxygen by mass, we can calculate the empirical formula as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    1. Assume a sample size of 100 grams.
    <br>
    2. Convert the percentages to grams:
    <br>
    - Carbon: 54.5 grams
    <br>
    - Hydrogen: 9.1 grams
    <br>
    - Oxygen: 36.4 grams
    <br>
    3. Convert the grams to moles:
    <br>
    - Carbon: 54.5 grams / molar mass of carbon
    <br>
    - Hydrogen: 9.1 grams / molar mass of hydrogen
    <br>
    - Oxygen: 36.4 grams / molar mass of oxygen
    <br>
    4. Determine the simplest mole ratio.
    <br>
    5. Write the empirical formula using the mole ratios.
    <br>
    6. Determine the molar mass of the empirical formula.
    <br>
    7. Calculate the ratio of the molar mass to the empirical formula mass to find the molecular formula.
  </p>

  <p>
    These calculations help us determine the empirical and molecular formulas from the percentage composition of a compound, allowing us to understand the composition and structure of substances.
