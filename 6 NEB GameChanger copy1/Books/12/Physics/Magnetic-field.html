        <h2>Magnetic Field Lines</h2>
        
        <p>Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines used to visualize and represent the magnetic field around a magnet or a current-carrying conductor. These lines provide a graphical representation of the direction and strength of the magnetic field at different points in space.</p>
        
        <p>Key characteristics of magnetic field lines include:</p>
        
        <ul>
           <li>Magnetic field lines are continuous and closed loops.</li>
           <li>The direction of the magnetic field lines indicates the direction of the magnetic field at a given point.</li>
           <li>The density of magnetic field lines represents the strength of the magnetic field, with closer lines indicating a stronger field.</li>
           <li>Magnetic field lines never intersect, as the direction of the magnetic field at a point can only have one value.</li>
           <li>Magnetic field lines tend to curve around the magnet or current-carrying conductor, forming concentric circles or other shapes depending on the geometry.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Magnetic Flux</h2>
        
        <p>Magnetic flux is a measure of the total magnetic field passing through a given surface. It is represented by the symbol \(\Phi\) and is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength (\(B\)) and the area (\(A\)) perpendicular to the magnetic field.</p>
        
        <p>The mathematical expression for magnetic flux is:</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">\(\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta)\)</p>
        
        <p>where:</p>

           <li>\(\theta\) is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the surface</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Magnetic flux is a useful concept in understanding the interaction of magnetic fields with conductors, as it is related to phenomena such as electromagnetic induction.</p>
        
        <h2>Oersted’s Experiment</h2>
        
        <p>Oersted’s experiment, conducted by Hans Christian Oersted in 1820, demonstrated the connection between electricity and magnetism. In the experiment, Oersted observed the deflection of a compass needle when placed near a current-carrying wire.</p>
        
        <p>The key observations and conclusions of Oersted’s experiment are:</p>
        
        <ul>
           <li>When a current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is produced around the wire.</li>
           <li>The magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire is circular, with the wire at the center of the circles.</li>
           <li>The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule, where the thumb points in the direction of the current and the curled fingers indicate the direction of the magnetic field.</li>

</head>
<body>

<h1>Force on Moving Charge; Force on a Conductor</h1>

<h2>Force on Moving Charge</h2>

<p>When a charged particle, such as an electron or a proton, moves in the presence of an electric or magnetic field, it experiences a force known as the Lorentz force. The Lorentz force acting on a moving charge ($q$) is given by the equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\vec{F}$ is the force experienced by the charge</li>
   <li>$\vec{E}$ is the electric field</li>
   <li>$\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge</li>
   <li>$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
</ul>

<p>The electric field component ($\vec{E}$) exerts a force on the charge due to its charge interaction, while the magnetic field component ($\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$) exerts a force due to the charge's motion in the magnetic field. The magnitude and direction of the force depend on the charge's velocity, the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, and the charge's charge.</p>

<h2>Force on a Conductor</h2>

<p>When a conductor carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force called the magnetic force. The force acting on a conductor carrying current ($I$) in a magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) is given by the equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\vec{F} = I(\vec{L} \times \vec{B})$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\vec{F}$ is the force experienced by the conductor</li>
   <li>$\vec{L}$ is the length of the conductor in the direction of the current</li>
   <li>$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
</ul>

<p>The force on the conductor is perpendicular to both the length of the conductor and the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force depends on the current flowing through the conductor, the length of the conductor, and the strength of the magnetic field.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>The force on moving charges and conductors has various applications in physics and engineering:</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Electric Motors and Generators:</strong> The interaction between the magnetic field and the current-carrying conductors is the basis of electric motors and generators, which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy (in motors) or vice versa (in generators).</li>
   <li><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):</strong> The force on moving charges is utilized in MRI machines to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. The magnetic fields and the motion of protons in the body produce signals that are detected and processed to generate the images.</li>
   <li><strong>Particle Accelerators:</strong> Powerful magnetic fields are used in particle accelerators to control and guide charged particles, allowing scientists to study the fundamental properties of matter and conduct experiments in high-energy physics.</li>
   <li><strong>Electromagnetic Induction:</strong> The force on a conductor in a magnetic field plays a crucial role in electromagnetic induction, which is the basis of electric power generation, transformers, and various electrical devices.</li>
   <li><strong>Magnetic Levitation:</strong> By utilizing the force on a conductor, magnetic levitation systems can suspend objects, such as trains or Maglev trains, above magnetic tracks, reducing friction and allowing for high-speed transportation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Force and Torque on Rectangular Coil, Moving Coil Galvanometer</h1>

<h2>Force on a Rectangular Coil</h2>

<p>When a rectangular coil carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the current. The force on a rectangular coil can be calculated using the following equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\vec{F} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{I} \cdot \vec{A}$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\vec{F}$ is the force on the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
   <li>$\vec{I}$ is the current flowing through the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{A}$ is the area of the coil</li>
</ul>

<p>The force is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current direction. The magnitude of the force depends on the strength of the magnetic field, the current flowing through the coil, and the area of the coil.</p>

<h2>Torque on a Rectangular Coil</h2>

<p>When a rectangular coil is placed in a magnetic field and current flows through it, it experiences a torque or turning moment. The torque on a rectangular coil can be calculated using the following equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\vec{\tau} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{I} \cdot \vec{A} \cdot \vec{n}$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\vec{\tau}$ is the torque on the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
   <li>$\vec{I}$ is the current flowing through the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{A}$ is the area of the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{n}$ is the perpendicular distance between the coil and the axis of rotation</li>
</ul>

<p>The torque causes the coil to rotate, and the direction of rotation depends on the direction of the current and the magnetic field.</p>

<h2>Moving Coil Galvanometer</h2>

<p>A moving coil galvanometer is a device used to measure small electric currents. It consists of a rectangular coil suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet. When a current flows through the coil, it experiences a torque, causing it to rotate.</p>

<p>The deflection of the coil is proportional to the current passing through it. By calibrating the galvanometer, it can be used as an ammeter or voltmeter to measure current or voltage, respectively.</p>

<p>The torque on the moving coil can be given by the equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\vec{\tau} = \vec{N} \cdot \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} \cdot \sin(\theta)$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\vec{\tau}$ is the torque on the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{N}$ is the number of turns of the coil</li>
   <li>$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field</li>
   <li>$\vec{A}$ is the area of the coil</li>
   <li>$\theta$ is the angle between the normal to the coil and the magnetic field</li>
</ul>

<p>The deflection of the coil can be measured using a pointer attached to the coil, which moves over a scale calibrated in units of current or voltage.</p>



<h1>Hall Effect</h1>

<p>The Hall Effect is a phenomenon in physics discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879. It describes the generation of a voltage across a conductor or semiconductor when it is subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the electric current flowing through it.</p>

<h2>Principle of Hall Effect</h2>

<p>When a current-carrying conductor or semiconductor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the current, a force acts on the moving charges due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the charges. This force, known as the Lorentz force, causes the charges to be deflected to one side of the conductor.</p>

<p>The accumulation of charges on one side of the conductor creates an electric field that opposes the further flow of charges. Eventually, the electric field becomes strong enough to balance the Lorentz force, resulting in a steady-state condition known as the Hall equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the force due to the magnetic field is exactly counteracted by the electric field, leading to a transverse potential difference, or Hall voltage, across the conductor.</p>

<h2>Hall Voltage and Hall Coefficient</h2>

<p>The Hall voltage ($V_H$) is directly proportional to the product of the magnetic field strength ($B$), the current ($I$), and a constant known as the Hall coefficient ($R_H$). The Hall coefficient depends on the material and geometry of the conductor or semiconductor.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$V_H = R_H \cdot \frac{IB}{t}$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$V_H$ is the Hall voltage</li>
   <li>$R_H$ is the Hall coefficient</li>
   <li>$I$ is the current</li>
   <li>$B$ is the magnetic field strength</li>
   <li>$t$ is the thickness of the conductor or semiconductor</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hall coefficient can provide information about the charge carriers in the material, such as their density and mobility.</p>

<h2>Applications of Hall Effect</h2>

<p>The Hall Effect has various applications in physics and engineering:</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Magnetic Field Measurement:</strong> The Hall Effect can be used to measure the strength and polarity of magnetic fields. Hall effect sensors are widely used in applications such as current sensors, position sensors, and magnetic field measurements.</li>
   <li><strong>Velocity and Displacement Measurements:</strong> By applying the Hall Effect in conjunction with the Lorentz force, it is possible to measure the velocity and displacement of moving objects.</li>
   <li><strong>Semiconductor Characterization:</strong> The Hall Effect is used to study the electrical properties of semiconductors, including their carrier concentration, mobility, and type (n-type or p-type).</li>
   <li><strong>Electrical Switches and Controls:</strong> Hall effect switches are employed in various electronic devices, such as proximity switches, automotive sensors, and brushless DC motors, due to their non-contact operation and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Force between Two Parallel Conductors and Definition of Ampere</h1>

<h2>Force between Two Parallel Conductors</h2>

<p>The force between two parallel conductors carrying electric currents is governed by Ampere's law. According to Ampere's law, the force per unit length between the two conductors is proportional to the product of their currents and inversely proportional to the distance between them.</p>

<p>The formula to calculate the force per unit length ($F$) between two parallel conductors carrying currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ separated by a distance $d$ is given by:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$F = \frac{{\mu_0 \cdot I_1 \cdot I_2}}{{2\pi \cdot d}}$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$F$ is the force per unit length between the conductors</li>
   <li>$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space ($4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{Tm/A}$)</li>
   <li>$I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents in the two conductors</li>
   <li>$d$ is the distance between the conductors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definition of Ampere</h2>

<p>The unit of electric current, the Ampere (A), is defined in terms of the force between two parallel conductors carrying current. One Ampere is defined as the current that, when flowing through two infinitely long parallel conductors placed one meter apart in a vacuum, produces a force per unit length of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ N/m between the conductors.</p>

<p>Therefore, the force per unit length formula can be rearranged to define the Ampere:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$1 \, \text{A} = \frac{{2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{N/m}}}{{\mu_0}}$</p>

<p>This definition establishes a relationship between electric current and the force between parallel conductors, allowing for the measurement and standardization of current using the Ampere unit.</p>
