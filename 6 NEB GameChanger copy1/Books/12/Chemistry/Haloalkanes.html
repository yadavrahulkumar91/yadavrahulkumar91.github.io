      <h2>8.1 Introduction</h2>
      <p>Haloalkanes, also known as alkyl halides, are organic compounds that contain halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bonded to carbon atoms. They are derived from alkanes by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms with halogen atoms.</p>
      <p>Haloalkanes are important compounds in organic chemistry and find applications in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and industrial processes.</p>
      <h2>8.2 Nomenclature, Isomerism, and Classification of Monohaloalkanes</h2>
      <h3>Nomenclature:</h3>
      <p>The IUPAC system is used for naming haloalkanes. The basic rules for nomenclature are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the longest carbon chain containing the halogen atom and name it as the parent chain.</li>
        <li>Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain to give the halogen atom the lowest possible number.</li>
        <li>Use prefixes (fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, or iodo-) to indicate the type and position of the halogen atom.</li>
        <li>Assign a number to each substituent (halogen atom or alkyl group) and indicate their positions in the name.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Examples of naming monohaloalkanes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CH<sub>3</sub>Cl - Chloromethane</li>
        <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br - Bromoethane</li>
        <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>F - 1-Fluorobutane</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Isomerism:</h3>
      <p>Haloalkanes can exhibit structural isomerism, where compounds with the same molecular formula have different structural arrangements.</p>
      <p>The main types of structural isomerism observed in haloalkanes are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Chain Isomerism: Isomers with different carbon chain arrangements.</li>
        <li>Positional Isomerism: Isomers with the halogen atom attached at different positions on the carbon chain.</li>
        <li>Functional Group Isomerism: Isomers with different functional groups (e.g., alkyl halide and alcohol).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Classification of Monohaloalkanes:</h3>
      <p>Monohaloalkanes can be classified based on the nature of the carbon atom to which the halogen is attached. The main classifications are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Primary (1°) Haloalkanes: The halogen atom is attached to a carbon atom bonded to only one other carbon atom.</li>
        <li>Secondary (2°) Haloalkanes: The halogen atom is attached to a carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms.</li>
        <li>Tertiary (3°) Haloalkanes: The halogen atom is attached to a carbon atom bonded to three other carbon atoms.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These classifications are important because they influence the reactivity and properties of haloalkanes. For example, tertiary haloalkanes are generally more reactive in substitution reactions compared to primary haloalkanes.</p>


      Certainly! Here's the information you requested on the preparation of monohaloalkanes from alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols:

      <h2>8.3 Preparation of Monohaloalkanes from Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alcohols</h2>
      
      <h3>From Alkanes:</h3>
      
      <p>Monohaloalkanes can be prepared from alkanes through a substitution reaction known as halogenation. The most common halogen used for this purpose is chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) or bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>).</p>
      
      <p>In the presence of heat or light, the halogen reacts with the alkane, replacing one of the hydrogen atoms to form a monohaloalkane. The reaction proceeds through a free radical mechanism, where the halogen radicals are generated:</p>
      
      \[ \text{CH}_4 + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{Cl} + \text{HCl} \]
      
      <p>The reaction can be generalized as:</p>
      
      \[ \text{R-H} + \text{X}_2 \rightarrow \text{R-X} + \text{HX} \]
      
      <p>Where R represents an alkyl group, X represents a halogen atom, and HX represents the hydrogen halide produced as a byproduct.</p>
      
      <h3>From Alkenes:</h3>
      
      <p>Monohaloalkanes can be prepared from alkenes through an addition reaction with a halogen molecule (Cl<sub>2</sub> or Br<sub>2</sub>). This reaction is known as halogenation of alkenes.</p>
      
      <p>The double bond of the alkene is broken, and each carbon atom of the double bond forms a new bond with a halogen atom. This results in the addition of a halogen atom to each carbon atom, leading to the formation of a monohaloalkane.</p>
      
      <p>The reaction can be represented as:</p>
      
      \[ \text{RCH=CH}_2 + \text{X}_2 \rightarrow \text{RCH(X)CH}_2\text{X} \]
      
      <p>Where R represents an alkyl group and X represents a halogen atom.</p>
      
      <h3>From Alcohols:</h3>
      
      Certainly! Here are four common methods for preparing alkyl halides from alcohols, along with the general reactions and example reactions:

<h2>Preparation of Alkyl Halides from Alcohols</h2>

<h3>1. Reaction with Hydrogen Halides</h3>

<p>This method involves the reaction of an alcohol with a hydrogen halide (H-X, where X is a halogen atom) to form an alkyl halide and water. The reaction proceeds through nucleophilic substitution.</p>

<p>The general reaction is:</p>

\[ \text{ROH} + \text{H-X} \rightarrow \text{R-X} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

<p>Where R represents an alkyl group.</p>

<p>An example reaction is the conversion of ethanol to ethyl bromide using hydrogen bromide:</p>

\[ \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + \text{HBr} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Br} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \]

<h3>2. Reaction with Thionyl Chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>)</h3>

<p>In this method, an alcohol reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>) to form an alkyl chloride, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). This reaction is known as the "Swern reaction."</p>

<p>The general reaction is:</p>

\[ \text{ROH} + \text{SOCl}_2 \rightarrow \text{R-Cl} + \text{SO}_2 + \text{HCl} \]

<p>An example reaction is the conversion of methanol to methyl chloride using thionyl chloride:</p>

\[ \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{SOCl}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{Cl} + \text{SO}_2 + \text{HCl} \]

<h3>3. Reaction with Phosphorus Halides (PX<sub>3</sub> or PBr<sub>3</sub>)</h3>

<p>This method involves the reaction of an alcohol with a phosphorus halide (PX<sub>3</sub> or PBr<sub>3</sub>) to form an alkyl halide and a phosphorus oxyhalide (OPX<sub>3</sub> or OPBr<sub>3</sub>). This reaction is known as the "Appel reaction."</p>

<p>The general reaction is:</p>

\[ \text{ROH} + \text{PX}_3 \rightarrow \text{R-X} + \text{OPX}_3 \]

<p>An example reaction is the conversion of ethanol to ethyl bromide using phosphorus tribromide (PBr<sub>3</sub>):</p>

\[ \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + \text{PBr}_3 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Br} + \text{OPBr}_3 \]

<h3>4. Reaction with Thionyl Chloride and Pyridine</h3>

<p>In this method, an alcohol is treated with a combination of thionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>) and pyridine (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N) to form an alkyl chloride

, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and hydrogen chloride (HCl). This reaction is a modified version of the "Swern reaction."</p>

<p>The general reaction is:</p>

\[ \text{ROH} + \text{SOCl}_2 + \text{pyridine} \rightarrow \text{R-Cl} + \text{SO}_2 + \text{HCl} \]

<p>An example reaction is the conversion of methanol to methyl chloride using thionyl chloride and pyridine:</p>

\[ \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{SOCl}_2 + \text{pyridine} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{Cl} + \text{SO}_2 + \text{HCl} \]

<p>These methods provide a way to convert alcohols into alkyl halides, allowing for the introduction of halogen atoms into the organic molecule.</p>


<h2>8.4 Physical Properties of Monohaloalkanes</h2>
<p>Monohaloalkanes, also known as alkyl halides, exhibit distinct physical properties due to the presence of the halogen atom. Some of the important physical properties include:</p>
<h3>1. Boiling Point and Melting Point:</h3>
<p>The boiling point and melting point of monohaloalkanes generally increase with increasing molecular size and molecular weight. This is because larger molecules have stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces, which require more energy to break. In general, the boiling points of monohaloalkanes follow the order: fluorides < chlorides < bromides < iodides.</p>
<h3>2. Solubility:</h3>
<p>Monohaloalkanes are relatively insoluble in water due to the hydrophobic nature of the alkyl group. However, they are soluble in organic solvents, such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and diethyl ether.</p>
<h3>3. Density:</h3>
<p>The density of monohaloalkanes tends to increase with increasing molecular weight.</p>
<h2>8.5 Chemical Properties, Substitution Reactions: SN1 and SN2 Reactions</h2>
<h3>Basic Concept:</h3>
<p>Monohaloalkanes are known for their reactivity, particularly in substitution reactions. Substitution reactions involve the replacement of the halogen atom with another group or atom. The two main types of substitution reactions observed in monohaloalkanes are SN1 (substitution nucleophilic unimolecular) and SN2 (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) reactions.</p>
