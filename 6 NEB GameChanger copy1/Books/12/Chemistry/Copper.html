        Certainly! Here's the revised information with chemical formulas written in MathJax format:

        <h1>7.1 Copper</h1>
        
        <h2>7.1.1 Occurrence and Extraction of Copper from Copper Pyrite</h2>
        
        <p>Copper is a widely occurring metal found in various ores and minerals. One of the most common copper ores is copper pyrite (\(CuFeS_2\)). The extraction of copper from copper pyrite involves several steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Crushing and Concentration: The copper pyrite ore is crushed and then concentrated by the froth flotation process, where the ore particles are selectively separated based on their hydrophobicity.</li>
          <li>Roasting: The concentrated ore is then roasted in the presence of excess air, converting copper pyrite to copper(I) oxide (\(Cu_2O\)) and sulfur dioxide (\(SO_2\)).</li>
          <li>Smelting: The roasted ore is mixed with silica (\(SiO_2\)) and heated in a furnace to undergo smelting. The silica combines with the impurities to form slag, while the copper(I) oxide is reduced to metallic copper (\(Cu\)) by the reaction:
          \[Cu_2O + Cu_2S \rightarrow 6Cu + SO_2\]</li>
          <li>Purification: The obtained crude copper is further purified by electrolysis, where it is used as the anode and pure copper is deposited on the cathode.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>7.1.2 Properties (with Air, Acids, Aqueous Ammonia, and Metal Ions) and Uses of Copper</h2>
        
        <p>Copper possesses several important properties that make it useful in various applications:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Reactivity with Air: Copper reacts slowly with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin layer of copper oxide (\(Cu_2O\) and \(CuO\)) on its surface. This layer imparts a characteristic reddish-brown color to copper objects.</li>
          <li>Reaction with Acids: Copper does not react with most acids under normal conditions. However, it can react with concentrated nitric acid (\(HNO_3\)) to form copper(II) nitrate (\(Cu(NO_3)_2\)), nitrogen dioxide (\(NO_2\)), and water (\(H_2O\)):
          \[3Cu + 8HNO_3 \rightarrow 3Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2NO_2 + 4H_2O\]</li>
          <li>Reaction with Aqueous Ammonia: Copper ions (\(Cu^{2+}\)) react with aqueous ammonia (\(NH_3\)) to form a deep blue complex called tetraamminecopper(II) complex:
          \[Cu^{2+} + 4NH_3 \rightarrow [Cu(NH_3)_4]^{2+}\]</li>
          <li>Reaction with Metal Ions: Copper can displace less reactive metals from their salt solutions. For example, it can displace silver from silver nitrate (\(AgNO_3\)) solution:
          \[Cu + 2AgNO_3 \rightarrow Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2Ag\]</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Copper is widely used in various applications due to its excellent electrical conductivity, malleability, and corrosion resistance. Some common uses of copper include electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, coins, jewelry, and electrical components.</p>
        
        <h2>7.1.3 Chemistry
        
         (Preparation, Properties, and Uses) of Blue Vitriol</h2>
        
        <p>Blue vitriol, also known as copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (\(CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O\)), is a bright blue crystalline solid. It can be prepared by dissolving copper oxide (\(CuO\)) or copper metal in dilute sulfuric acid (\(H_2SO_4\)):</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Reaction with Copper Oxide:
          \[CuO + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow CuSO_4 + H_2O\]</li>
          <li>Reaction with Copper Metal:
          \[Cu + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow CuSO_4 + H_2O\]</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Blue vitriol has the following properties:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Crystal Structure: It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system and is commonly found as pentahydrate crystals (\(CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O\)).</li>
          <li>Solubility: It is highly soluble in water, and its aqueous solution is acidic.</li>
          <li>Hydrated and Anhydrous Forms: Blue vitriol exists as both hydrated and anhydrous forms. The pentahydrate (\(CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O\)) is the most common form.</li>
          <li>Color: It exhibits a vibrant blue color, which is responsible for its name.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Blue vitriol finds various applications, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Electroplating: It is used in electroplating processes to create a copper coating on objects.</li>
          <li>Agriculture: Blue vitriol is used as a fungicide and pesticide in agriculture to control fungal and bacterial infections.</li>
          <li>Laboratory Reagent: It is employed as a reagent in laboratories for various chemical reactions and analytical procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7.1.4 Other Compounds of Copper (Red Oxide and Black Oxide of Copper) Formula and Uses Only</h2>
        
        <p>Copper forms other compounds with distinct colors and properties:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Red Oxide of Copper: The red oxide of copper, also known as cuprous oxide (\(Cu_2O\)), is a reddish-brown powder. It is used as a pigment in ceramics, glass, and antifouling paints.</li>
          <li>Black Oxide of Copper: The black oxide of copper, also known as cupric oxide (\(CuO\)), is a black solid. It is utilized as a catalyst in various chemical reactions and as a pigment in ceramics and glass.</li>
