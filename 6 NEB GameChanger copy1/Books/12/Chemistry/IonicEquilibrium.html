      <h2>2. Ionic Equilibrium: Introduction to Acids and Bases</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Limitations of Arrhenius Concepts of Acids and Bases</h3>
      <p>The Arrhenius concept of acids and bases, proposed by Svante Arrhenius, defined acids as substances that release hydrogen ions (\(H^+\)) in aqueous solution, and bases as substances that release hydroxide ions (\(OH^-\)) in aqueous solution. However, this concept has certain limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is limited to aqueous solutions, as it focuses on the behavior of substances in water.</li>
        <li>It does not explain the acidic or basic behavior of substances in non-aqueous solvents.</li>
        <li>It does not account for substances that can act as acids or bases without producing \(H^+\) or \(OH^-\) ions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.2 Bronsted-Lowry Definition of Acids and Bases</h3>
      <p>The Bronsted-Lowry definition, proposed by Johannes Nicolaus Bronsted and Thomas Martin Lowry, provides a broader and more general definition of acids and bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An acid is a substance that donates a proton (\(H^+\)).</li>
        <li>A base is a substance that accepts a proton (\(H^+\)).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to this definition, an acid-base reaction involves the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base.</p>
      <h3>2.3 Relative Strength of Acids and Bases</h3>
      <p>The strength of an acid or a base refers to its tendency to donate or accept a proton, respectively. The relative strength of acids and bases can be determined by their ability to dissociate or ionize in water:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong acids completely dissociate in water, producing a high concentration of \(H^+\) ions. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (\(HCl\)), sulfuric acid (\(H_2SO_4\)), and nitric acid (\(HNO_3\)).</li>
        <li>Weak acids only partially dissociate in water, resulting in a low concentration of \(H^+\) ions. Examples of weak acids include acetic acid (\(CH_3COOH\)) and carbonic acid (\(H_2CO_3\)).</li>
        <li>Strong bases completely ionize in water, generating a high concentration of \(OH^-\) ions. Examples of strong bases include sodium hydroxide (\(NaOH\)) and potassium hydroxide (\(KOH\)).</li>
        <li>Weak bases only partially ionize in water, producing a low concentration of \(OH^-\) ions. Examples of weak bases include ammonia (\(NH_3\)) and methylamine (\(CH_3NH_2\)).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The strength of an acid or a base is also influenced by factors such as molecular structure, polarity, and stability of the conjugate base or acid formed after proton transfer.</p>
      <h3>2.4 Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs</h3>
      <p>In any acid-base reaction, the acid donates a proton to the base, forming a conjugate base, and the base accepts the proton, forming a conjugate acid. These pairs of substances are called conjugate acid-base pairs.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the reaction between hydrochloric acid (\(HCl\)) and water (\(H_2O\)), \(HCl\) donates a proton and acts as an acid, forming the conjugate base chloride ion (\(Cl^-\)). Water accepts the proton and acts as a base, forming the conjugate acid hydronium ion (\(H_3O^+\)).</li>
        <li>In the reaction between ammonia (\(NH_3\)) and hydrochloric acid (\(HCl\)), \(NH_3\) accepts a proton and acts as a base, forming the conjugate acid ammonium ion (\(NH_4^+\)). Hydrochloric acid donates the proton and acts as an acid, forming the chloride ion (\(Cl^-\)).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.5 Lewis Definition of Acids and Bases</h3>
      <p>The Lewis definition, proposed by Gilbert N. Lewis, further expands the concept of acids and bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An acid is a substance that accepts a pair of electrons.</li>
        <li>A base is a substance that donates a pair of electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This definition allows for the inclusion of substances that do not contain hydrogen but can still act as acids or bases. Lewis acids are electron pair acceptors, and Lewis bases are electron pair donors.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the reaction between boron trifluoride (\(BF_3\)) and ammonia (\(NH_3\)), \(BF_3\) accepts a pair of electrons from \(NH_3\) and acts as a Lewis acid. \(NH_3\) donates a pair of electrons and acts as a Lewis base.</li>
        <li>In the reaction between silver ions (\(Ag^+\)) and chloride ions (\(Cl^-\)), \(Ag^+\) accepts a pair of electrons from \(Cl^-\) and acts as a Lewis acid. \(Cl^-\) donates a pair of electrons and acts as a Lewis base.</li>
      </ul>

<h3>2.6 Ionization of Weak Electrolyte (Ostwald's Dilution Law)</h3>
<p>Weak electrolytes are substances that only partially ionize in water, resulting in the presence of both ions and uncharged molecules in the solution. Ostwald's dilution law relates the degree of ionization of a weak electrolyte to its concentration and dissociation constant.</p>
<p>According to Ostwald's dilution law:</p>
<p>\[\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{{K_c}}{{C}}} \]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\alpha\) is the degree of ionization (fraction of molecules that ionize)</li>
  <li>\(K_c\) is the dissociation constant of the weak electrolyte</li>
  <li>\(C\) is the concentration of the weak electrolyte</li>
</ul>
<p>This law indicates that the degree of ionization increases with decreasing concentration or increasing dissociation constant.</p>

<h3>2.7 Ionic Product of Water (\(K_w\))</h3>
<p>The ionic product of water (\(K_w\)) represents the equilibrium constant for the self-ionization of water:</p>
<p>\[2H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + OH^-\]</p>
<p>At a given temperature, the value of \(K_w\) is constant and is equal to \(1 \times 10^{-14}\) at 25Â°C.</p>
<p>In pure water, the concentration of \(H^+\) ions is equal to the concentration of \(OH^-\) ions, each being \(1 \times 10^{-7}\) M. However, in acidic solutions, the concentration of \(H^+\) ions is greater than \(1 \times 10^{-7}\) M, while in basic solutions, the concentration of \(OH^-\) ions is greater than \(1 \times 10^{-7}\) M. The product of the \(H^+\) and \(OH^-\) concentrations in any aqueous solution is always equal to \(K_w\) (\(1 \times 10^{-14}\)).</p>

<h3>2.8 Dissociation Constant of Acid and Base (\(K_a\) and \(K_b\))</h3>
<p>The dissociation constant (\(K_a\)) of an acid and the dissociation constant (\(K_b\)) of a base are measures of their strengths and indicate the extent to which they ionize in water.</p>
<p>For an acid (\(HA\)):</p>
<p>\[HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-\]</p>
<p>The dissociation constant \(K_a\) is given by:</p>
<p>\[K_a = \frac{{[H^+] \cdot [A^-]}}{{[HA]}}\]</p>
<p>For a base (\(B\)):</p>
<p>\[B + H_2O \rightleftharpoons BH^+ + OH^-\]</p>
<p>The dissociation constant \(K_b\) is given by:</p>
<p>\[K_b = \frac{{[BH^+] \cdot [OH^-]}}{{[B]}}\]</p>
<p>Strong acids have high \(K_a\) values, indicating complete or almost complete ionization, while weak acids have low \(K_a\) values, indicating partial ionization.</p>
<p>Strong bases have high \(K_b\) values, indicating

 complete or almost complete ionization, while weak bases have low \(K_b\) values, indicating partial ionization.</p>

<h3>2.9 Concept of pKa and pKb</h3>
<p>The concept of pKa and pKb is used to express the strength of acids and bases on a logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>The pKa of an acid is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of its \(K_a\) value:</p>
<p>\[pKa = -\log_{10} K_a\]</p>
<p>The pKb of a base is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of its \(K_b\) value:</p>
<p>\[pKb = -\log_{10} K_b\]</p>
<p>Lower pKa or pKb values indicate stronger acids or bases, respectively.</p>

<h3>2.10 pH Value: pH of Strong and Weak Acids, pH of Strong and Weak Bases</h3>
<p>The pH scale is used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The pH value is determined based on the concentration of \(H^+\) ions in the solution.</p>
<p>The pH is defined as:</p>
<p>\[pH = -\log_{10} [H^+]\]</p>
<p>For strong acids, which completely ionize in water, the concentration of \(H^+\) ions is equal to the initial concentration of the acid. Therefore, the pH of a strong acid solution can be calculated directly using the concentration of the acid.</p>
<p>For weak acids, the pH calculation requires considering the degree of ionization (\(\alpha\)) using Ostwald's dilution law and the initial concentration of the acid. The pH can be determined using the equation:</p>
<p>\[pH = -\log_{10} (\alpha \cdot [HA])\]</p>
<p>For strong bases, which completely dissociate in water, the concentration of \(OH^-\) ions is equal to the initial concentration of the base. The pH of a strong base solution can be calculated using the concentration of the base and the equation:</p>
<p>\[pOH = -\log_{10} [OH^-]\]</p>
<p>\[pH = 14 - pOH\]</p>
<p>For weak bases, the pH calculation requires considering the degree of ionization (\(\alpha\)) using Ostwald's dilution law and the initial concentration of the base. The pH can be determined using the equation:</p>
<p>\[pOH = -\log_{10} (\alpha \cdot [B])\]</p>
<p>\[pH = 14 - pOH\]</p>

<h3>2.11 Solubility and Solubility Product Principle</h3>
<p>Solubility refers to the ability of a solute to dissolve in a solvent to form a homogeneous mixture called a solution. The solubility of a compound is typically expressed in terms of the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature.</p>
<p>The solubility product principle states that for a sparingly soluble salt in equilibrium with its ions in a saturated solution, the product of the concentrations of the ions raised to their stoichiometric coefficients is constant at a given temperature.</p>
<p>For a salt with the general formula \(MX_n\), the solubility product expression is:</p>
<p>\[K_{sp} = [M]^a[X] ^b\]</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(K_{sp}\) is the solubility product constant</li>
  <li>\([M]\) and \([X]\) are the equilibrium concentrations of the ions</li>
  <li>\(a\) and \(b\) are the stoichiometric coefficients of the ions</li>
</ul>
<p>The solubility product constant allows us to predict the solubility of a salt and determine whether a precipitate will form when solutions containing the ions are mixed.</p>

<h3>2.12 Common Ion Effect</h3>
<p>The common ion effect describes the phenomenon in which the presence of a common ion in a solution reduces the solubility of a slightly soluble salt.</p>
<p>When a sparingly soluble salt is dissolved in a solution that already contains one of its ions as a result of the presence of a soluble salt, the equilibrium is shifted toward the side of the reaction that forms the insoluble salt. As a result, the solubility of the sparingly soluble salt decreases.</p>
<p>The common ion effect can be explained using Le Chatelier's principle. The additional presence of the common ion reduces the concentration of one of the ions involved in the equilibrium, causing the equilibrium to shift to the left and favor the formation of the sparingly soluble salt.</p>

<h3>2.13 Application of Solubility Product Principle and Common Ion Effect in Precipitation Reactions</h3>
<p>The solubility product principle and the common ion effect have several applications in precipitation reactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Predicting Precipitation: By comparing the value of the solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) with the product of the concentrations of the ions in a solution, it is possible to determine whether a precipitate will form.</li>
  <li>Selective Precipitation: The solubility product principle can be used to selectively precipitate one ion from a mixture of ions by adjusting the concentration of a common ion to decrease the solubility of a particular salt.</li>
  <li>Purification of Substances: Precipitation reactions based on the solubility product principle can be used to remove impurities from a solution by precipitating them as insoluble salts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.14 Buffer Solution and Its Application</h3>
<p>A buffer solution is a solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added to it. It consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.</p>
<p>Buffer solutions are important in various applications, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Biological Systems: Buffers help maintain

 the pH of biological fluids, such as blood, within a narrow range, ensuring proper functioning of enzymes and physiological processes.</li>
  <li>Chemical Reactions: Buffer solutions are used in chemical reactions where it is necessary to maintain a specific pH range for the reaction to occur optimally.</li>
  <li>Analytical Techniques: Buffers are used in various analytical techniques, such as acid-base titrations, to control and maintain the pH of the solution during the titration process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.15 Indicators and Selection of Indicators in Acid-Base Titration</h3>
<p>Indicators are substances that change color in different pH ranges and are used to visually determine the endpoint or equivalence point in acid-base titrations.</p>
<p>The selection of an appropriate indicator depends on the expected pH range at the equivalence point. Some commonly used indicators and their pH ranges are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Phenolphthalein: pH range of 8.2 to 10.0</li>
  <li>Methyl Orange: pH range of 3.1 to 4.4</li>
  <li>Bromothymol Blue: pH range of 6.0 to 7.6</li>
  <li>Phenol Red: pH range of 6.8 to 8.4</li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting an indicator, it is important to choose one that changes color within the expected pH range of the equivalence point of the titration.</p>




<h3>2.16 Types of Salts: Acidic Salts, Basic Salts, Simple Salts, Complex Salts</h3>
<p>Salts are formed when acids react with bases, resulting in the neutralization of their respective acidic and basic properties. Depending on the nature of the acid and base involved, salts can be classified into various types:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Acidic Salts:</strong> Acidic salts are salts that produce an acidic solution when dissolved in water. They are formed by the partial neutralization of a polyprotic acid with a base. Examples of acidic salts include sodium hydrogen sulfate (\( \text{NaHSO}_4 \)) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (\( \text{NH}_4\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4 \)).</li>
  <li><strong>Basic Salts:</strong> Basic salts are salts that produce a basic solution when dissolved in water. They are formed by the partial neutralization of a weak acid with a strong base. Examples of basic salts include magnesium hydroxide (\( \text{Mg(OH)}_2 \)) and calcium carbonate (\( \text{CaCO}_3 \)).</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Salts:</strong> Simple salts are neutral salts that neither produce acidic nor basic solutions when dissolved in water. They are formed by the complete neutralization of a monoprotic acid with a base. Examples of simple salts include sodium chloride (\( \text{NaCl} \)) and potassium sulfate (\( \text{K}_2\text{SO}_4 \)).</li>
  <li><strong>Complex Salts:</strong> Complex salts are salts that contain complex ions or coordination complexes. These salts often have a transition metal ion surrounded by ligands. Examples of complex salts include potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) (\( \text{K}_4\text{Fe(CN)}_6 \)) and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (\( \text{CuSO}_4 \cdot 5\text{H}_2\text{O} \)).</li>
</ol>

<h3>2.17 Hydrolysis of Salts</h3>
<p>Hydrolysis of salts refers to the reaction between the ions of a salt and water, resulting in the formation of acidic or basic solutions. The nature of the salt and its constituent ions determines the extent and direction of the hydrolysis reaction.</p>
<h4>2.17.1 Salts of Strong Acid and Strong Base</h4>

  </tr>
</table>
<h4>2.17.3 Salts of Weak Base and Strong Acid</h4>
<p>Salts that are derived from the combination of a weak base and a strong acid undergo hydrolysis to produce an acidic solution. The weak base reacts with water to generate hydronium ions. Examples include ammonium chloride (\( \text{NH}_4\text{Cl} \)) and aluminum chloride (\( \text{AlCl}_3 \)). The hydrolysis equations for these salts are:</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Salt</th>

  <tr>
    <td>\( \text{NH}_4\text{Cl} \)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( \text{AlCl}_3 \)</td>
    <td>\( \text{AlCl}_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Al(OH)}_3 + 3\text{HCl} \)</td>
  </tr>
