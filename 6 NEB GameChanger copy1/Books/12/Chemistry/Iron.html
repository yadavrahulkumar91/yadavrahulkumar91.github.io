        <h2>7.4 Iron</h2>
        
        <h3>7.4.1 Occurrence and Extraction of Iron</h3>
        <p>Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust and is found in various minerals. The main ores of iron include hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>). The extraction of iron from these ores involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Crushing and Grinding: The iron ore is first crushed and ground to a fine powder.</li>
          <li>Magnetic Separation: The powdered ore is passed through a magnetic separator to separate magnetic iron ore (magnetite) from non-magnetic impurities.</li>
          <li>Roasting: The magnetic iron ore is then roasted in a blast furnace to remove impurities and convert it into a more concentrated form called iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).</li>
          <li>Reduction: The iron oxide is reduced with carbon (coke) in a blast furnace to obtain molten iron (pig iron) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
            <p>\[\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s) + 3\text{C}(s) \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}(l) + 3\text{CO}_2(g)\]</p></li>
          <li>Purification: The molten pig iron is further processed to remove impurities and obtain pure iron.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>7.4.2 Properties and Uses of Iron</h3>
        <p>Iron possesses several important properties and finds numerous practical applications:</p>
        
        <h4>Properties:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Iron is a lustrous, silvery-gray metal with high tensile strength and hardness.</li>
          <li>It has a relatively high melting point of 1538°C and a density of 7.87 g/cm³.</li>
          <li>Iron is malleable and ductile, allowing it to be easily shaped and drawn into wires.</li>
          <li>It is a good conductor of heat and electricity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Uses:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Iron is primarily used in the production of steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon.</li>
          <li>It is widely utilized in construction, machinery, transportation, and infrastructure projects.</li>
          <li>Iron is a vital component of various tools, equipment, and appliances.</li>
          <li>It plays a crucial role in the manufacturing of automobiles, ships, and bridges.</li>
          <li>Iron is also used in the production of magnets, pigments, and fertilizers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.4.3 Manufacture of Steel by Basic Oxygen Method and Open Hearth Process</h3>
        <p>The manufacture of steel involves the conversion of pig iron into steel by removing impurities and adjusting the carbon content. Two commonly used methods for steel production are the Basic Oxygen Method and the Open Hearth Process:</p>
        
        <h4>Basic Oxygen Method:</h4>
        <p>In the Basic Oxygen Method, molten pig iron is combined with oxygen in a basic oxygen furnace
        
        . The oxygen reacts with impurities in the pig iron, such as carbon, silicon, and manganese, forming gaseous oxides that are removed. The process allows precise control over the composition of the steel. Various alloying elements can be added to achieve specific properties. The Basic Oxygen Method is the most common method for steel production today.</p>
        
        <h4>Open Hearth Process:</h4>
        <p>In the Open Hearth Process, pig iron and scrap steel are melted together in an open hearth furnace. The furnace is lined with a basic refractory material, such as magnesite or dolomite, to withstand high temperatures. The impurities in the pig iron are oxidized and removed by the addition of fluxes, such as limestone and silica. The process is slower compared to the Basic Oxygen Method but allows for better control of the steel composition and is suitable for producing alloy steels.</p>
        
        <h3>7.4.4 Corrosion of Iron and Its Prevention</h3>
        <p>Iron is prone to corrosion, which is the deterioration of the metal due to chemical reactions with its environment. The most common form of corrosion of iron is the formation of rust (iron oxide) in the presence of oxygen and moisture. Several methods are employed to prevent or reduce the corrosion of iron:</p>
        
        <h4>Protective Coatings:</h4>
        <p>Iron surfaces can be coated with protective layers to prevent direct contact with the environment. Common coating methods include painting, galvanizing (applying a layer of zinc), and applying epoxy or polymer coatings.</p>
        
        <h4>Barrier Methods:</h4>
        <p>Creating a barrier between iron and the environment can prevent corrosion. This can be achieved through the use of greases, oils, or corrosion-resistant materials, such as stainless steel.</p>
        
        <h4>Electrochemical Protection:</h4>
        <p>Methods such as cathodic protection can be used to protect iron by making it the cathode in an electrochemical cell. This involves connecting the iron to a sacrificial anode (a more easily corroded metal), which will corrode in place of the iron.</p>
        
        <h4>Controlled Atmospheres:</h4>
        <p>Controlling the atmosphere around iron objects by reducing moisture and oxygen exposure can significantly reduce corrosion. This can be achieved by storing iron objects in dry environments or using desiccants.</p>
        
        <h4>Alloying:</h4>
        <p>Alloying iron with other elements, such as chromium and nickel, can enhance its corrosion resistance. Stainless steel, for example, contains chromium, which forms a protective oxide layer on the surface, preventing further corrosion.</p>
