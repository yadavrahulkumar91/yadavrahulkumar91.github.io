        <p><strong>Duration of experiment:</strong> 1856-1864 (8 yrs)</p>
        <p><strong>Experimental material:</strong> Pisum sativum i.e., Garden pea (2n=14)</p>
        <p><strong>Mendel did unsuccessful experiment on Hawkweed (Hieracium).</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>This plant was cross pollinated plant and reproduced by Parthenogenesis.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Mendel presented his work in Brunn Natural history society.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>His paper was entitled as "Experiments in plant hybridization".</strong></p>
        <p><strong>His work was rediscovered in 1900 by 3 scientists independently:</strong></p>

            <li>Hugo de Vries</li>
            <li>Correns</li>
            <li>Tschermark</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>His work was republished in "Flora" (in 1901).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mendel selected following 7 pairs of Contrasting character of Pisum sativum for his study.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Reasons for choosing pea plant:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Well defined distinct contrasting characters</li>
            <li>Self-fertilization</li>
            <li>Hermaphrodite</li>
            <li>Short-life span</li>
            <li>Hybridisation is easy</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Mendel was successful in formulating the laws of inheritance whereas his predecessors were not because:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>He considered single trait at a time</li>
            <li>The characters he considered were present on separate chromosomes and shows no linkage. [IOM 1996]
                <ul>
                    <li>a. But now, it has been proved (by Blext) that the 7 traits are present on only 4 different chromosomes (chromosome 1, 4, 5 and 7).</li>
                    <li>b. Due to greater distance between the genes, there was no linkage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>He made statistical analysis.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>B. Experiments of Mendel</h1>
        <h2>I. Monohybrid cross</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>If the cross involves the single pair of contrasting character, it is considered as monohybrid cross.</li>
          <li>Eg: Cross between tall plant and Dwarf plant i.e., plant height.</li>
          <li>Law of dominance and Law of Segregation can be explained on the basis of monohybrid cross.</li>
          <li></li>
          <li>In Monohybrid cross
            <ul>
              <li>Phenotypic ratio= 3:1</li>
              <li>No. of phenotypes = 2 (tall and Dwarf)</li>
              <li>Genotypic ratio = 1:2:1</li>
              <li>No. of genotypes = 3 (Pure tall, hybrid tall, Pure dwarf)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Facts
            <ul>
              <li>No. of homozygous dominant as well as no. of homozygous recessive always remains 1 in F2 generation of any type of hybridization cross.</li>
              <li>Proportion of homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive in F<sub>2</sub> generation = 1/4<sup>n</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Law of dominance
            <ul>
              <li>When two plants having one pair of contrasting characters are crossed only one of the 2 parental characters appears in heterozygous genotype of the offsprings of F<sub>1</sub> generation.</li>
              <li>Phenomenon of dominant can't be studied in haploids. (Eg. Algae, Fungi and Bryophytes)</li>
              <li>Exception of Law of Dominance
                <ol>
                  <li>Incomplete dominance</li>
                  <li>Co-dominance</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>1. Law of Segregation/ Law of Splitting of hybrid/ Law of purity of gamete/ Mendel's first law</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>a. Dominant and recessive factor which stay together in hybrid offspring of F<sub>1</sub> generation do not mix or contaminate or blend with each other and gets segregated from each other during anaphase I of meiosis. This is called as Law of segregation.</li>
		<li>b. Also known as Purity of gametes because each gamete is pure after segregation i.e., either T or t.</li>
		<li>c. Evidence is production of 2 types of phenotypes in F<sub>2</sub> generation.</li>
		<li>d. Considered is a Universal law.</li>
		<li>e. Law of segregation justifies that gametes never become hybrid.</li>
		<li>f. Law of purity of gametes justifies that genes are particulate in nature.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Segregation of dominant or recessive factors in Pisum sativum occurs during</li>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Gamete formation</li>
				<li>Spore formation</li>
				<li>Zygote formation</li>
				<li>Fertilization</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Segregation of dominant or recessive factors in Pisum sativum occurs during</li>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Gamete formation</li>
				<li>Zygote formation</li>
				 <li>Parthenogenesis</li>
				<li>Fertilization</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Segregation of dominant or recessive factors in Pisum sativum occurs during</li>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Metaphase-I</li>
				<li>Anaphase-I</li>
				<li>Anaphase-II</li>
				<li>Both b and c</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
	</ol>

	<h2>II. Dihybrid cross</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>If the cross involves the two pairs of contrasting characters, it is considered as dihybrid cross.</li>
		<li>2 alleles and 4 characters</li>
		<li><strong>In Dihybrid cross</strong></li>
		<ul>
			<li>a. Phenotypic ratio = 9:3:3:1</li>
			<li>b. No. of phenotypes = 4</li>
			<li>c. Genotypic ratio = 1:2:1:2:4:2:1:2:1</li>
			<li>d. No. of genotype = 9</li>
			<li>e. Results of Dihybrid cross in F<sub>2</sub> generation:</li>
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Ratio between non-recombinant to recombinant offsprings = 5:3</li>
				<li>No. of offspring having both the traits dominant = 9</li>
				<li>Genotypic ratio of the offspring having both the traits dominant = 1:2:2:4</li>


                
                    <li>No. of the offspring having genotype like their parents: 4</li>
                    <li>Ratio of parental offsprings: 10:16</li>
                    <li>Ratio of recombinant offspring: 6:16</li>
                    <li>Ratio of homozygous offspring: 4:16</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>Law of Independent Assortment/ Mendel's 2nd law</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It is conclusion of dihybrid cross.</li>
                    <li>According to law of independent assortment, when two pairs of contrasting characters are considered in hybridization, all characters assort (preparation in group) in an independent manner.</li>
                    <li>Exception of this law is Linkage.</li>
                    <li>Note:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Recombinant produced in dihybrid cross of Mendel are result of Independent Assortment. But, recombinant produced in linkage are result of crossing over.</li>
                      <li>Mendelian principles cannot be applied on prokaryotes where sexual reproduction is absent.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>

                  <h1>C. Special points</h1>
                  <h2>I. When two non-allelic genes are present in separate non-homologous chromosomes they are called as independently assorting gene.</h2>
                  <h2>II. Independently assorting gene gives the result of independent assortment.</h2>
                  <h2>III. When two non-allelic genes are present on same chromosome, they are called as Linked gene.</h2>
                  <h2>IV. Linked gene gives the result of Linkage. [IOM 2009]</h2>
                  <h2>V. When linked genes are present far apart i.e., frequency of crossing over becomes 50%, linked gene start to give the result of independent assortment in place of linkage.</h2>
                  <h2>VI. Penotypic ratio = Genotypic ratio in test cross →2^n</h2>
                      <h3>1. Monohybrid cross = 1:1</h3>
                      <h3>2. Dihybrid cross = 1:1:1:1</h3>
                  <h2>VII. Formulae and Methods as follows</h2>
                      <h3>1. No. of offsprings in F<sub>2</sub> generation = 4^n</h3>
                      <h3>2. Type of gamete produced from homozygous genotype → Always one</h3>
                          <p>a. Eg: AABBCC → 1</p>
                          <p>b. Aabbccdd → 1</p>
                      <h3>3. Type of gamete produced from heterozygous genotype = 2^n.</h3>
                          <p>a. Eg: AaBbCc→2^3=8</p>
                          <p>b. AaBBCcddEe→2^3=8</p>
                      <h3>4. No. of homozygous dominant gamete as well as homozygous recessive gamete produced from any type of hybrid is always 1.</h3>
                      <h3>5. Proportion of homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive gamete =1/2^n</h3>
                      <h3>6. Phenotypic ratio in F<sub>2</sub> generation →(3:1)^n,   {n→type of cross}</h3>


                      <h1>Importance of Mendelism</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Different breeds in animals and different varieties in plant are possible due to Mendelism.</li>
		<li>Science of Eugenics (Development of superior progeny) is based on Mendelism.</li>
		<li>Heterosis or Hybrid vigour has been utilized in plants and animals is based on Mendelism.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Crosses</h1>
	<h2>Reciprocal cross:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Two crosses in which one dominant character is taken from Female(♀) parent and recessive character from male (♂)  and second cross is vice-versa.</li>
		<li>Reciprocal cross gives same result. It proves that sex has no effect on phenotype.</li>
		<li>Exceptions:
			<ul>
				<li>When reciprocal cross gives different result</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Sex linked inheritance</li>
					<li>Cytoplasmic inheritance/ Uniparental inheritance/ Maternal inheritance</li>
				</ol>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Back cross</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Cross between F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and parent (either dominant or recessive) i.e., between Tt and TT or Tt and tt. [MOE 2009]</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Test cross:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Back cross of hybrid with homozygous recessive is called as test cross or cross between F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and homozygous recessive parent i.e., between Tt and tt.</li>
		<li>Test cross is used to differentiate heterozygous from homozygous dominant.</li>
		<li>Selfing can be used in place of test cross to test purity of an individual having dominant character.</li>
		<li>Animal breeders use back cross of hybrid with homozygous dominant to produce pure line.</li>
		<li>Pure lines consists of homozygous individuals of a particular character.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Out cross:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Cross between F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and dominant parent i.e., cross between Tt and TT.</li>
