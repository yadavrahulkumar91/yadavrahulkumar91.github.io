      <h1>Secondary Growth</h1>
      <p>Tissue systems provide the framework for plant growth and development, from the root to the leaf.</p>

        <p>
            Increase in thickness of plant body due to addition of secondary tissue by the activity of vascular and cork cambium in stelar and extrastelar region respectively is called <strong>Secondary growth</strong>.<br>
            It occurs in <em>Dicot</em>.<br>
          </p>
          <h3>A. Secondary growth in Dicot stem:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Cells of medullary rays, become meristematic and form interfascicular cambium to join intrafascicular cambium to form a complete ring called Cambium ring.</li>
            <li>The cambium ring consists of 2 types of cells, the fusiform initials and the ray initials.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Fusiform initials form secondary phloem on the exterior and secondary xylem on the interior side.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>That present in secondary xylem is known as Wood or Xylem ray and that is secondary phloem is called Phloem ray.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Ray initials form parenchymatous medullary rays.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In spring (favourable season), cambium produces conducting elements of wider diameter called Spring or Early wood.</li>
            <li>In winter, it produces elements of narrow diameter known as Autumn or Late wood.</li>
            <li>Each year's growth is distinct due to sudden stem appear as concentric rings known as Growth rings/ Annual rings and represent total wood formed in a year.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Each year's growth is distinct due to sudden transition from autumn wood to spring wood of next year. The transition from spring to autumn wood is gradual.</li>
              <li>Annual rings are used to study the climate of that area known as Dendroclimatology.</li>
              <li>Annual rings are formed due to unequal activity of cambium in autumn and spring season.</li>
              <li>Annual rings are absent in plants growing in places having uniform climate.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>The age determination of trees by counting the annual growth rings is known as <em>Dendrochronology</em>.</p>

            <p>The wood of older stems (eg. Dalbergia) gets differentiated into outer lighter and functional sapwood or alburnum and inner darker or non-functional heartwood or Duramen.</p>
            <p>Stumps of broken branches also get embedded in secondary xylem (produced by secondary growth) to form Knots.</p>
            <p>Process by which plant becomes woody is called Lignification.</p>
            <p><strong>A. Tyloses are found in</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Secondary xylem</li>
              <li>Secondary phloem</li>
              <li>Callus tissue</li>
              <li>Cork cells</li>

            <p><strong>B. Callose are found in</strong></p>

            <p>Pressure is created by addition of tissues and a meristematic zone of cork cambium (Phellogen) in the outer (extrastelar) zone. It originates either from outer cortical cells or collenchyma or epidermis.</p>
            <p>Cork cambium gives rise to secondary cortex (or phelloderm) on the inner side  and cork (or Phellem) outside.</p>
            <p>All new tissues, cork cambium, secondary cortex and cork formed in peripheral region are together known as periderm and all the dead tissue lying outside vascular cambium is called Bark; they possess lenticels, for gaseous exchange.</p>
