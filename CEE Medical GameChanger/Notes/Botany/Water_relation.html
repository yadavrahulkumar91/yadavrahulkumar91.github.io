			<li>i. Temperature:
				<ol>
					<li>Increase in temperature leads to increase in mineral salt absorption but very high temperature decreases salt absorption due to denaturation of protein carriers.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>ii. pH:
				<ol>
					<li>In general decrease in pH leads to increase in anions absorption whereas increase in pH leads to increase in cations absorption.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>iii. O2:
				<ol>
					<li>Active mineral salt absorption is decreased by decrease in O2 concentration.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>iv. Ageing:
				<ol>
					<li>Salt absorption is decreased by increase in age of the roots due to suberization.</li>

<h2>C. Ascent of Sap</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Upward movement of H<sub>2</sub>O with dissolved minerals through lumen of xylem vessels against force of gravity is called Ascent of sap.
  </li>
  <li>
    Path of ascent of sap in gymnosperm is Tracheids.

  <li>
    Best experiment to show path of ascent of sap is Ringing or Girdling experiment.
    <ol type="i">
      <li>It is removal of bark in the form of complete ring.</li>

<h1>D. Transpiration</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Transpiration is loss of water vapour (i.e., pure form) from aerial parts of plants.</li>
		<li>Transpiration occurs when the outer atmosphere has less moisture than substomatal cavities.</li>
		<li>The conditions under which transpiration would be most rapid are low humidity, high temperature, guard cell turgid (open), moist soil.</li>
		<li>Transpiration increases in hot, dry and windy conditions.</li>
		<li>Transpiration is reduced due to deposition of cutin.</li>
		<li>Rate of transpiration is reduced when decrease in light intensity.</li>
		<li>Loss of water occurs in pure form (i.e., water not mixed with minerals).</li>
		<li>Transpiration is necessary to plant for absorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and minerals, ascent of sap and maintaining body temperature(cooling effect).</li>
		<li>Transpiration is a "Controlled phenomenon".</li>
		<li>Transpiration doesn't occur from roots.</li>
		<li>"Transpiration is a necessary evil" by Curtis.</li>
		<li>In herbaceous plant, 99% of total water absorbed by plants is lost thorough transpiration. So, only 1-2% is actually used by them. [IOM 2000]</li>
		<li>Transpiration mostly occurs through 3 sites:
			<ul>
				<li>Stomata:
					<ol>
						<li>Maximum (90% of total transpiration).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Cuticle: 
					<ol>
						<li>About 9% of total transpiration.</li>
						<li>Transpiration through General body surface.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Lenticel:
					<ol>
						<li>Very less, about 1%</li>
						<li>Present in bark of woody trees.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Transpiration rate of a dorsiventral leaf is higher on the lower surface due to higher number of stomata. [BPKIHS]</li>
		<li>Transpiration from the 2 leaf surfaces are compared by dry paper strips previously soaked in solution of cobalt chloride. i.e., cobalt chloride test is done to observe unequal transpiration in a dorsiventral leaf.
			<ul>
				<li>Change in the colour of cobalt chloride paper from blue to pink [Hydrated - pink; dry - blue] indicated that water vapour evaporated from both the surfaces of the leaf. But the quick change in the colour of CoCl<sub>2</sub>  paper at the lower surface indicates higher rate of transpiration from the lower than that of the upper surface.</li>
				<li>Dry CoCl<sub>2</sub>→Blue</li>
				<li>Moist CoCl<sub>2</sub>→Pink</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Bell jar experiment shows loss of water vapour from the aerial parts of plant by transpiration.</li>
		<li>Rate of transpiration is measure by Ganong's potometer.</li>
		<li>The opening and closing of the stomatal pore regulate the process of stomatal transpiration which is due to the change in turgor pressure of the guard cells.

          <h2>Factors affecting transpiration:</h2>
    <h3>a. Plant factors or Internal factors</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Root/shoot ratio:</strong> Higher the root/shoot ratio, more will be the rate of transpiration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leaf area:</strong>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>In general, more is the leaf area, more will be the transpiration. Hence, xerophytes plants have reduced leaf surface transformed into spines.</li>
          <li>On per unit area basis, smaller plants transpire at much higher rate as compared to larger plants.</li>
          <li>Removal of leaves from a plant increases transpiration per unit area.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cuticle:</strong> The thinner the cuticle, the greater in the rate of cuticular transpiration. Xerophytic plants have thick cuticle to minimize transpiration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stomata:</strong> Usually, greater is the number of stomata per unit area, greater is the rate of transpiration. Sunken stomata found in xerophytes reduce the rate of transpiration.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>b. External or Environmental factors</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Light:</strong>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Light is very important factor in opening and closing of stomata.</li>
          <li>Usually, stomata open in day and close in the darkness.</li>
          <li>Maximum opening of stomata occurs in red light (660 nm), followed by blue light (445 nm) and no opening occurs in green light, UV-light and far red light.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Temperature:</strong> Rate of transpiration increases with increasing temperature upto 35°C.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relative humidity (R.H.):</strong>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Rate of transpiration is inversely proportional to Relative humidity.</li>
          <li>Low humidity of air increases the rate of transpiration.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wind:</strong>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Rate of transpiration is increased in gently blowing wind by removing saturated air from around the transpiring area.</li>
          <li>Rate of transpiration is decreased in violently blowing wind.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Soil condition:</strong> As transpiration depends upon the absorption, soil condition effect the rate of transpiration.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Special point:</strong> Rate of transpiration is maximum in matured leaf.</p>

    <h1>Anti-transpirants</h1>

      <li>Abscisic acid (ABA), Salicylic acid, Aspirin</li>
      <li>Waxy substances like silicon emulsion</li>
      <li>High concentration of CO<sub>2</sub></li>

<h1>Significance of Transpiration</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Only 1-2% of absorbed water is used by plants. Transpiration helps in removal of excess of water.</li>
  <li>Transpiration maintains the temperature of plant body.</li>
  <li>Transpiration exerts sunction force in the leaf surface which helps in the ascent of sap.</li>
  <li>The ash and sugar content of the fruit increases with increase in transpiration.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Disadvantages of Transpiration</h1>
<ol>
  <li>High rate of transpiration causes wilting of plants.</li>
  <li>Reduces photosynthesis, growth is stopped.</li>
  <li>High rate of transpiration inhibits production of flowers, fruits and seeds.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Guttation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Due to root pressure.</li>
  <li>Guttation is loss of water (in the form of liquid droplets) from margin and tip (but mainly margin) of leaves.</li>
  <li>Lost water drop is impure as it may contain dissolved minerals.</li>
  <li>In guttation, plants can get rid of excess water.</li>
  <li>Guttation occurs through hydathodes (water stomata).</li>
  <li>Hydathodes are found in margin and tip of the leaves (but mainly margin).
    <ul>
      <li>Loosely arranged mass of parenchyma in hydathode is called Epithem.</li>
      <li>Note: Hydathodes remain always open.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Guttation occurs during early morning or night when rate to transpiration is low and absorption is high. This ultimately increases root pressure. So, guttation is not due to activity of hydathodes but due to root pressure.</li>
  <li>Water drops present on leaf margins of Tropaeolum, Balsam and Grasses in early morning are due to Guttation.</li>
  <li>Occurs in moist environment in mesophytic herbs like tomato, balsam, cucurbita, Colocassia, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guttation is an uncontrolled phenomenon.</p>

  <h1>Exudation/Bleeding</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Exudation is the loss of water sap from incision of plant body parts.</li>
      <li>Exudation of water from leaf incision: Bleeding</li>
      <li>Exudation of water from leaf margin: Guttation</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Wilting</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Loosening of plant part.</li>
  <li>Wilting occurs when transpiration &gt; Water absorption, due to loss of turgidity.</li>
  <li>It occurs when xylem is blocked or xylem is removed.</li>
  <li>Percentage of water left in the soil when plant wilts is known as, permanent wilting coefficient(PWC)/ Permanent wilting percentage(PWP).</li>
  <li>During wilting the sequence of event shall be:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Exosmosis</li>
    <li>Plasmolysis</li>
    <li>Temporary wilting</li>
    <li>Permanent wilting</li>
  </ul>
  <li>3 types:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Incipient wilting: Not visible due to partial loss of turgidity.</li>
    <li>Temporary wilting: It happens during hot days when rate of transpiration is high and rate of absorption is less and is recovered at night. It is reversible process.</li>
    <li>Permanent wilting: Plants fails to recover/ return to original state. Xylem vessels are blocked. It is irreversible process.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Note: During wilting there is wrinkling of cell wall because during wilting there is only loss of water with no replacement.</li>
