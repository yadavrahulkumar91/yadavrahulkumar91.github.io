      <h1>Growth and Plant hormones</h1>
      <p>Growth and plant hormones control every aspect of plant development, from the roots to the flowers and beyond.</p>
    </header>
    <main>

        <h2>Growth</h2>
<p>
  <strong>I. </strong>Sequential process involved in growth:<br>
  <span>&emsp; &sect; Cell division &rarr; Cell enlargement &rarr; Cell differentiation</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>II. </strong>Maximum cell elongation occurs in region behind the root/shoot.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>III. </strong>Growth is Quantitative change.<br>
  <span>&emsp; 1. But, Development is Qualitative + Quantitative</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>IV. </strong>Growth is primarily affected by two climatic factors which are light and temperature.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>V. </strong>During growth, there is an increase in dry weight, permanent change in size, volume, the number of cells.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>VI. </strong>Growth curve &rarr; 'S' shaped sigmoid curve.<br>
  <span>&emsp; 1. Plant growth<br>
  &emsp; 2. Bacterial growth in the lab</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>VII. </strong>Growth is measured by Auxanometer, Horizontal microscope, Crescograph.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>VIII. </strong>The classical experiments in growth were performed by Boysen-Jensen and Darwin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>IX. </strong>Phases of Growth = 4<br>
  <span>&emsp; 1. Lag phase &rarr; Initiating phase, Slow cell division.<br>
  &emsp; 2. Log phase (exponential) &rarr; Maximum growth, Fast cell division.<br>
  &emsp; 3. Deaccelerating phase &rarr; Decreased in growth rate.<br>
  &emsp; 4. Stationary phase &rarr; Constant growth</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A. </strong>Plant growth is<br>
  <span>&emsp; 1. Limited<br>
  &emsp; 2. Unlimited<br>
  &emsp; 3. Unlocalized<br>
  &emsp; Diffused</span>
</p>
<p>A. Growth promoter phytohormones</p>
<ul>
  <li>Growth regulators are the organic substances which are required for the growth and are called Hormones.</li>
  <li>The term hormone was given by "Starling".</li>
  <li>The existence of growth promoting substance in plant was given by Darwin â†’ Observed in Canary grass (Phalaris canariensis)</li>
  <li>Nature of Hormone:
    <ul>
      <li>Naturally produced organic substance.</li>
      <li>Active in minute amount.</li>
      <li>Acts at a site remote from its production i.e., they are produced in one part and transferred to some other part where their physiological effects are observed.</li>
      <li>May have promotory or Inhibitory role.</li>
      <li>Hormones are used up after biochemical reaction while enzymes are unchanged after biochemical reaction.</li>
      <li>Hormones are synthesized in meristematic region of plants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hormones were originally measure with bioassays but now most hormones are measured by Gas chromatography and Immunoassay technique.</li>
  <li>All three growth promoter hormones are required for tissue culture.</li>
</ul>
