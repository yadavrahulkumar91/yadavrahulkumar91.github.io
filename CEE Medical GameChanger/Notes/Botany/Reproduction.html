	</ol>

    <h2>E. Fertilization</h2>
<p>
    a. The process of fusion of male and female gamete to form zygote is called as fertilization.<br>
    b. Before, the male gamates are carried to embryo sac by pollen tube (siphonogamous)<br>
    <ul>
        <li>The pollen tube enter the ovule through:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Chalaza: Chalazogamy or Basigamy/Eg. Casuarina.</li>
            <li>Integument Mesogamy/Eg: Cucurbita</li>
            <li>Micropyle: Porogamy.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Most common one is porogamy.</li>
    </ul>
    c. Most active part of ovule is chalaza.<br>
    d. The pollen tube invariably enters the embryo sac at micropylar end.<br>
    e. Pollen tube secretes pectinases and other hydrolytic enzymes to create a passage for its entry to style.<br>
    f. Movement of pollen tube is chemotactic.<br>
    g. Pollen tube is attracted by Synergids though filliform apparatus.<br>
    h. Pollen tube releases its two male gametes and tube nucleus (degenerating) into the synergid.<br>
    i. Double fertilization is unique characteristic of angiosperm.<br>
    j. In all, 5 nuclei are involved in double fertilization. But the gametes taking part are 3.<br>
    k. Double fertilization and Triple fusion<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Double fertilization discovered by Nawaschian in Fritilaria and Lilium</li>
        <li>Among two nucleus formed by small generative nucleus one fuses with secondary to form endosperm and other with egg cell to form zygote. This is character of Angiosperm and is called double fertilization and triple fusion.</li>
    </ul>
    l. Endosperm<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Endosperm is a characteristic storage tissue, which supplies nutrition to the developing embryo.</li>
        <li>Being storage tissue, the cells of endosperm are isodiametric, thin-walled and generally without pits.</li>
        <li>Development of endosperm is from Primary Endosperm Nucleus (i.e., result of triple fusion).</li>
        <li>Proteinaceous part of maize (most of the cereals) endosperm is aleurone layer.</li>
        <li>Aleurone layer occurs in the peripheral region of endosperm. [BPKIHS]</li>
        <li>The endosperm in gymnosperms is pre-fertilization tissue and is equivalent to female gametophyte, hence haploid in nature.</li>
        <li>But, in angiosperms, it is post-fertilization tissue and is generally triploid in nature.</li>
        <li>The endosperm in angiosperms is (eg. maize) triploid and formed after fertilization while in case gymnosperms, it is haploid and formed before fertilization. [OM 2003, 2004]</li>
        <h1>Types of Endosperm in Angiosperms</h1>
        <p>No endosperm is formed in members of families Orchidaceae, Podostemaceae and Trapaceae.</p>
        <p>On the basis of mode of development, there are 3 types of endosperm reported in angiosperms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nuclear type: most common type.
            <ul>
              <li>Found in Malvaceae, Papilionaceae, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Cellular type:
            <ul>
              <li>Found in Magnoliaceae.</li>
              <li>Note: Endosperm of coconut is unique in sense that it is both nuclear and cellular.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Helobial type: This is intermediate between first two.
            <ul>
              <li>It is found in mostly monocots.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Endosperm is haploid in gymnosperms not in monocots.</p>


        <pre>
            <code>
            <p><strong>xi. Coconut milk (liquid endosperm of coconut) = contains auxins, cytokinins and GA and induces cytokinesis.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>xii. Young endosperm of maize (milky) also induces cytokinesis and a very common cytokinin "zeatin" is extracted from milky endosperm of maize.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>xiii. Mature endosperm does not have stimulatory property.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>xiv. Non-endospermic seeds or ex-albuminous seeds: Here no endosperm is left at maturity in seeds or seeds are without endosperm. eg. seeds of gram, pea, beans, Tamarindus (Imli), orchids, etc. are non-endospermic or exalbuminous seeds.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>xv. Endospermic or albuminous seeds: Here endosperm is not fully utilized and some amount is left in seeds. eg. seeds of wheat, rice, barley, poppy, palms, maize etc. are endospermic or albuminous.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>xvi. Xenia:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>It is the direct effect of pollens on structures inside embryo sac except embryo. But now the term xenia is used</li>
              <li>in strict sense to denote direct effect of pollens on endosperm character. eg. Maize.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>xvii. Metaxenia:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>It is the direct effect of pollens on structures outside embryo sac or endosperm (seed coat / fruit wall) i.e. in date palm maturity time as well as size of fruits can be changed by using different pollens, hence date palm is example of metaxenia.</li>
            </ol>
            </code>
            </pre>


            <h2>F. Embryo development (Embryogenesis)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>a. Fertilized egg is known as zygote (2n), which on division and differentiation gives rise to embryo.</li>
  <li>b. This process of development of embryo is called embryogenesis.</li>
  <li>c. The main axis of the embryo is called tigellum.</li>
  <li>d. An embryo has the capacity to develop into a complete plant (Thus, embryo is future miny or tiny plant inside the seed)</li>
  <li>e. Hofmeister proposed the origin of embryo from existing cell of embryo sac not from pollen tube.
    <ul>
      <li>Embryo development in Dicot</li>
      <li>Embryo development in Monocot
        <ul>
          <li>A typical dicot embryo (common type is onagrad type or ranunculaceous type) is having an embryonal axis and 2 cotyledons attached to it laterally.</li>
          <li>A monocot embryo differs from a dicot embryo mainly in having a single cotyledon (instead of two).</li>
          <li>The portion of embryonal axis above the point of attachment of cotyledons is called epicotyl and the portion below the point of attachment of cotyledons is called hypocotyl.</li>
          <li>Terminal cells forms the embryo.</li>
          <li>Below the point of attachment of cotyledons is called hypocotyl.</li>
          <li>In grasses (monocots), structure and development of embryo is different from other monocots.</li>
          <li>At the terminal end of epicotyl is plumule (embryonic shoot) and the hypocotyl at its end bears radicle (embryonic root).</li>
          <li>A grass embryo (e.g. Triticum or wheat) is having single cotyledon, which is called "Scutellum".</li>
          <li>The embryonal axis below the attachment of scutellum is called hypocotyl, which at its tip is having radicle, bearing apical meristem and root cap at its lower end.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h1>Nutrition of Embryo</h1>
	<p>Main nutritive tissues for embryo are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Endosperm</li>
		<li>Perisperm: Remnant of nucellus or persistent nucellus surrounding the embryo.</li>
		<li>Chalazosperm: Nucellar cells in chalasal region of ovule is called Chalazosperm, which stores fats and starch and is substitue for endosperm. Chalazoperm is found in Cyanastrum.</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>Polyembryony</h1>
	<p>Process of developing more than one embryo in the same seed.</p>
	<p>Discovered by Leeuwenhoek in citrus.</p>
	<p>Very common in gymnosperms.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Simple polyembryony is presence of more than one embryo sac. Eg: Brassica.</li>
		<li>Mixed polyembryony is due to entry of more than one pollen tube in an embryo sac and fusion of extra male gametes with synergids or antipodals Eg: Allium.</li>
		<li>Cleavage polyembryony is due to cleavage of the embryo to produce two or more embryos. Eg: orchids.</li>
		<li>Adventive polyembryony is due to growth of diploid nucellar or integument cells into embryos. Eg: Citrus.</li>
	</ol>
