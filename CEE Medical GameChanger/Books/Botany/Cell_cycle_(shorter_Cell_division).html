<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<li>The cell cycle is defined as the sequence of events in which the cell accumulates large amount of nutrition and then divides into daughter cells.</li>
		<li>The process of forming daughter cells from parent cell is called Cell division.</li>
		<li>Note: Generation time/ cell cycle time is the total time taken by the parent cell to divide into daughter cell.</li>
		<li>The sequence of events that occurs between two cell divisions is called Cell cycle.</li>

    <h3>Meiosis/ Reductional Cell Division</h3>
	<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Common in germ cells/ reproductive cells.</li>
		<li>Single cell divides to form 4 daughter cells.</li>
		<li>Occurs in pollen mother cell.</li>
		<li>The daughter cells produced at the end of meiosis when compared to the parent diploid cells will have</li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Same amount of DNA and</li>
			<li>Half no. of chromosome</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Two divisions of nucleus and only one division of chromosome in meiosis.</li>
		<li>Best material for study of meiosis is Anthers of Onion or Tradescantia.</li>
		<li>Meiosis occurs at any stage of life-cycle.</li>
		<li>Cell involves in meiosis is called meiocyte cell (divides once in life times).</li>
		<li>Meiosis is never followed by meiosis.</li>
		<li>Meiosis can be followed by mitosis.</li>
		<li>In alternation of generation, meiosis is always followed by fusion (fertilization).</li>
		<li>Meiosis takes place in Diploid and Polypoids and never in haploid.</li>
		<li>A single primary spermatocyte (2n) and a single primary oocyte (2n) will respectively produce 4 sperms and 1 egg. But, a single secondary spermatocyte (n) and a single secondary oocyte (n) give 2 sperms and 1 egg 🥚 respectively.</li>

      <h2>One. Leptotene</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>a. Chromosomes are thread like and beaded called Chromomere.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Bead structure in chromatin is Nucleosome.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>b. Bouquet &#x1F490; formation occurs so called "bouquet stage".</li>
		<li>c. Best stage for the observation of chromomere.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Two. Zygotene</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>a. Synapsis occurs.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Lengthwise pairing of homologous chromosomes in a very precise manner i.e., chromomere to chromomere is called as Synapsis or Syndesis or Zipping.</li>
			<li>2. Synapsis occurs in zipper-like fashion and may begin at centromere or at ends of chromosome or at any point.</li>
			<li>3. Synapsis is favoured by Synaptonemal complex (protein).</li>
			<ul>
				<li>1. Synaptonemal complex is Tripartite.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>4. Each pairing of homologous chromosomes is called bivalent which exist in the form of Dyad (2 stranded stage).</li>
		</ul>
		<li>b. Thickening and Shortening of chromosome occur.</li>
		<li>c. Note:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Bivalent is produced in diploid and allopolyploid.</li>
			<li>2. Multivalent is produced in autopolyploid.</li>
			<li>3. No. of bivalents =1/2 the no. of total chromosomes in a diploid cell.</li>
			<li>Q. During synapsis the number of threads (Chromonemata) in each chromosome is</li>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>5</li>
				<li>8</li>
				<li>4</li>
				<li>Many</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>Three. Pachytene (Longest in Prophase-I)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>a. Most important sub-stage of Prophase-I.</li>
		<li>b. Thickest chromosome.</li>
		<li>c. Exchange of genetic material/ chromatid segments/ DNA/ genes (i.e., Crossing over) takes place.</li>
		<li>d. Crossing over occurs at 4-stranded stage.</li>
		<li>e. Occurrence of single, double and triple crossing over is in the order.<br>Single &gt; Double &gt; Triple</li>
		<li>f. Crossing over is favoured by 3 main enzymes.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Endonuclease: For breakdown (Nicking)</li>
			<li>2. Unwindase: For separation</li>
			<li>3. Ligase: For rejoining</li>
		</ul>

        <li>g. Equal exchange of segments occurs between non-sister chromatids (homologous chromatids) of homologous chromosome during crossing over.
            <ul>
                <li>Note: Crossing over is the major source of continuous variation in sexually reproducing organisms. But the ultimate source of variation is mutation, which produces discontinuous variation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>h. Synapsis and synaptonemal complex and bivalent becomes mature.</li>
        <li>i. Sister chromatids become visible thus bivalents exists in the form of tetrad i.e., Tetrad formation occurs in Pachytene.
            <ul>
                <li>1. Tetrad contains 2 homologous chromosome, 4 chromatids, 2 centromere and 4 kinetochore.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>j. Morphological details of the chromosome are best studied.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Four. Diplotene</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>a. Formation of chiasmata takes place.</li>
		<li>b. Synaptonemal complex starts to dissolve except at few points called Chiasmata (indication of crossing over).</li>
		<ol type="Q">
			<li>Chiasmata formation occurs in</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Leptotene</li>
				<li>Zygotene</li>
				<li>Pachytene</li>
				<li>Diplotene</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note: Chiasmata formation takes place during pachytene but is clearly visible during Diplotene.</p>
		</ol>
		<li>c. Profuse decondensation of lampbrush chromosomes in the female species producing yolk eggs. E.g: All vertebrates and some invertebrates.</li>
		<li>d. In female, ovum remain in diplotene stage from birth to puberty. So, Diplotene is longest in human female.</li>

<h2>Five. Diakinesis</h2>
<ul>
	<li>a. Chiasmata disappears due to terminalization.</li>
	<li>b. Movement of chiasmata occurs form centromere to telomere in a zipper like fashion which is called as terminalization.</li>
	<li>c. At the end of diakinesis each chromosomes has two chromatids called dyad.</li>
	<li>d. Formation of spindle fibers is started and nuclear membrane, nucleolus, nucleoplasm starts to disappear.</li>
	<li>e. Formation of spindle fibres is started and nuclear membrane, nucleolus, nucleoplasm starts to disappear.</li>
	<li>f. Note:</li>
	<ol type="A">
		<li>Terminalisation starts during Diakinesis.</li>
		<li>Terminalization occurs and ends during Diakinesis.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>appears in Zygotene,</li>
			<li>Persists in pachytene (more clear) and</li>
			<li>Disappears during diplotene.</li>
