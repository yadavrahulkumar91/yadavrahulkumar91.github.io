    <h1>Diffusion</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Diffusion is movement of ions, free atoms, molecules or particles from their higher concentration region to their lower concentration region along the concentration gradient until the molecules are evenly distributed throughout the available space is called diffusion.</li>
		<li>It is a passive process.</li>
		<li>Movement of particles is due to Kinetic energy.</li>
		<li>
			Diffusion regions
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Diffusing particles (Solid, Liquid, Gas)</li>
				<li>Diffusing medium (Liquid or Gas)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Diffusion pressure
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Diffusion pressure is a hypothetical term which describes the potential ability of a solid, liquid or gas to diffuse from its higher concentration to lower concentration.</li>
				<li>Diffusion pressure of a pure solvent (as water 1236 atm) is always higher than the solution.</li>
				<li>Eg: If sugar solution is made in water, then D.P. of solution is lower than water (solvent).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Diffusion Pressure Deficit (DPD) or Suction Pressure
			<ol type="i">
				<li>DPD = Water absorbing capacity</li>
				<li>DPD ∝ Concentration of solution</li>
				<li>The diffusion pressure of a pure solvent is always more than that of its solution.</li>
				<li>The amount by which the diffusion pressure of a solution is lower than that of its pure solvent (when solute particles are added) is called DPD or Suction pressure.</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			Water potential (Ψ)
			<ol type="i">
				<li>Free energy per mole of water molecule is called water potential.</li>
				<li>Water potential is represented by Greek letter 'Ψ' (Psi).</li>
				<li>Ψ of pure water is Zero and addition of solute in it, decreases its Ψ (i.e., -ve value)</li>
				<li>Ψ of protoplasm is equal but opposite in sign to D.P.D.</li>

    <h2>8. Rate of diffusion:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>∝ Diffusion pressure gradient.</li>
      <li>∝ Temperature (Stops at 0 K)</li>
      <li>∝1/Humidity</li>
      <li>∝1/(Distance between diffusing particles)</li>
      <li>∝1/(Size of diffusing particle)</li>

          <li>{∴Diffusion of Gas>Liquid>Solid}</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>∝1/√(Density of medium in which diffusion occurs)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>9. Q<sub>10</sub> (temperature coefficient) of diffusion=1.2-1.3</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Note: Temperature coefficient of most of the chemical reaction (2-3).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>10. Examples of Diffusion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gaseous exchange (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O vapour) with the atmosphere through stomata and lenticels
        <ol>
          <li>Diffusion, however, is not involved in opening and closing of stomata. Here, Osmosis is involved.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Aroma of flower is due to diffusion of volatile aromatic compounds.</li>
      <li>Movement of particles in protoplasm i.e., within cells, particles generally move by diffusion.</li>
      <li>Passive uptake of minerals is also a diffusion.</li>
      <li>Movement of minerals through semipermeable membrane is also diffusion (not osmosis).</li>
      <li>Movement of water molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration without semipermeable membrane is also diffusion.</li>
      <li>When diffusion of two or more substances takes place simultaneously at the same time, it is called independent diffusion.
        <ol>
          <li>Gaseous exchange in respiration and photosynthesis, loss of water vapour in transpiration are the examples of independent diffusion.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Movement of dissolved substances through semipermeable membrane with the help of carrier protein is called facilitated diffusion. Eg: Transport of fructose.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>B. Osmosis</h2>
    <ol>
      <li></li>
      <li>Osmosis is defined as the movement of solvent from a region of lower concentration to the higher concentration of the solute across the semi-permeable membrane.</li>
      <li>Osmosis can also be defined as the diffusion of water molecules from the region of their higher concentration to a region of their lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.</li>
      <li>Osmosis is also a diffusion process. Osmosis is a special type of diffusion, the only difference being the presence of a semi-permeable membrane.</li>
      <li>Osmosis continues until hydrostatic pressure becomes equal to osmotic pressure.</li>
      <li>Osmosis requires
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Difference in concentration of solution</li>
          <li>Semi-permeable membrane</li>

        <ol type="i">
          <li>Dilute solution to concentrated solution</li>
          <li>Hypotonic solution to hypertonic solution i.e., against the concentration gradient of solution.</li>
          <li>Low osmotic pressure to high osmotic pressure.
            <ul>
              <li>Osmosis is not possible in isotonic pressure.</li>

          </li>
          <li>Low DPD to high DPD
            <ul>
              <li>Note: Osmotic pressure and DPD ∝ Concentration of solute</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Higher water potential to lower water potential</li>
          <li>Higher free energy level to lower free energy level
            <ul>
              <li>Free energy of water is considered as 0.</li>
              <li>It becomes lower due to addition of dissolved solute.</li>
              <li>So, free energy of water in solution is always negative.</li>

      <h1>Osmosis and its Significance in Plants</h1>
      <ol>
          <li>
              Osmosis is exhibited only by living tissue as in dead cells, semi-permeability is lost. So, a boiled potato 🥔 does not show osmosis.
              <ul>
                  <li>When a cell is kept in hypertonic solution after treating with alcohol, there will be no change as osmosis/semi-permeability is lost.</li>

          <li>
              Significance of Osmosis in plants
              <ul>
                  <li>Osmosis helps in absorption of water by plants.</li>
                  <li>The turgidity of plant organs is dependent on water which is absorbed due to osmosis.</li>
                  <li>Movement of water from one cell to another is due to osmosis.</li>
                  <li>The resistance of plants to drought and frost is brought about by osmosis.</li>
                  <li>Opening and Closing of stomata is brought about by Osmosis.</li>

        <li>The resultant force for the direction of movement of water is DPD.</li>
        <li>Water enters into the root from soil on account of Suction pressure (DPD).</li>
        <li>DPD is a driving force of the absorption of water in roots.</li>
        <li>In normal condition DPD = +ve {OP > TP}.</li>
        <li>DPD can never be negative.</li>
        <li>DPD = 0 for pure water.</li>

  <h2>Plasmolysis:</h2>
  <p>
      Plasmolysis is shrinking of protoplast due to exosmosis when cell is placed in hypertonic solution.
  </p>
  <h3>Types:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Incipient plasmolysis: Protoplast just leave the cell wall.</li>
      <li>Full plasmolysis: It is complete shrinkage of protoplast.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Plasmolysis helps to determine:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Permeable nature of cell wall and semi-permeable nature of cell membrane can be determined by plasmolysis.</li>
      <li>OP of cell</li>
      <li>Living or dead nature of an unknown cell.</li>
      <li>Best/ Quickest physiological process to identify living or dead cell is plasmolysis.<sup>® Note: Plasmolysis is not possible in dead cell.</sup></li>
      <li>In a plasmolysed cell (flaccid cell), the space between cell wall and cell membrane is filled up by outer solution.</li>
      <li>During plasmolysis, there is no wrinkling of cell wall because space between cell wall and cell membrane is filled with hypertonic solution.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Due to plasmolysis:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Plants cannot survive in area having excessive fertilizer.</li>
      <li>Bacteria cannot survive in salted pickles.</li>
      <li>Salt is spread in tennis 🎾 court to kill weed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Deplasmolysis:</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>A plasmolysed cell regains normal condition, if placed in hypotonic solution, it is called deplasmolysis.</li>
      <li>Bursting of cell in pure solvent/ dilute medium is plasmoptysis.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Imbibition:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Imbibition is a surface phenomenon by which solvent is adsorbed (not absorbed) on the surface of particle without forming a solution making them swell.</li>
      <li>Imbibition is movement of water into imbibant through diffusion as well as capillary action.</li>
      <li>The solvent which is adsorbed is called imbibate.</li>
      <li>The solute which adsorbs is called Imbibant.</li>
      <li>Only the solid substances containing hydrophilic colloids can adsorb H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Examples:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Seed coat</li>
      <li>Cell wall</li>
      <li>Woody tissue (wood)</li>
      <li>Velamen tissue, etc</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Imbibition</h2>
  <p>Imbibition is a surface phenomenon by which solvent is adsorbed (not absorbed) on the surface of particle without forming a solution making them swell.</p>
  <p>Imbibition is movement of water into imbibant through diffusion as well as capillary action.</p>
  <p>The solvent which is adsorbed is called imbibate.</p>
  <p>The solute which adsorbs is called Imbibant.</p>
  <p>Only the solid substances containing hydrophilic colloids can adsorb H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Seed coat</li>
      <li>Cell wall</li>
      <li>Woody tissue (wood)</li>
      <li>Velamen tissue</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Swelling of dry seeds when placed in H<sub>2</sub>O is due to imbibition.</p>
  <p>First physiological process during seed germination/ H<sub>2</sub>O absorption from root hairs is Imbibition.</p>
  <p>Seed germination is accompanied by evolution of heat.</p>
  <p>During rainy season, wooden doors swell due to imbibition which caused difficulty in their opening and closing.</p>
  <p>Wooden pieces present in rock crevices, when soaked in water may rupture the rock due to imbibition pressure.</p>
  <p>Agar is a very efficient imbibant. It imbibes (99 times its mass) of water and is therefore used in bacterial culture.</p>
  <p>Rubber never imbibes water, it only imbibes ether and other organic solvents like kerosene.</p>
  <p>Due to imbibition:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Volume of imbibant is increased.</li>
      <li>Pressure is exerted</li>
      <li>Heat is released (exothermic process)</li>
      <li>Increase in temperature caused increase in imbibition.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In terms of imbibition, DPD=Imbibition pressure−TP</p>
  <p><strong>Special point:</strong></p>
  <ol>
      <li>There should be some forces of attraction between imbibant and imbibed liquid or affinity between imbibant and imbibed liquid is necessary for imbibition to occur.</li>
      <p>Eg: if wooden piece soaked in ether, no swelling or no imbibition, but wooden piece in water shows swelling due to imbibition. Similarly, rubber soaked in H<sub>2</sub>O shows no imbibition and rubber in ether shows imbibition.</p>
      <li>First step in imbibition is adsorption i.e., attachment of liquid on the surface.</li>
      <li>Imbibition involves diffusion as well as capillary action.</li>
      <li>Adsorption is the property of colloids and hence the material which have high proportion of colloids, are good imbibants.</li>
      <li>It is for this reason, the wood (plant material) is good imbibant, because it contains proteins, cellulose and starch as colloidal substances.</li>
      <li>The imbibition capacity of</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Agar&gt;Pectin&gt;Protein&gt;Starch&gt;Cellulose</li>

        </ul>
        <li>			vii. Imbibition does not occur in waxy substance (eg. Cutin)</li>
            <li>
            Swelling of seed in water is due to imbibition.</li>
