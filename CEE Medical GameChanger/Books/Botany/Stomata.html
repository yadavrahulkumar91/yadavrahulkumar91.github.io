        <h1>Stomata</h1>
        <p>Stomata are minute pores found on the epidermis of leaves. The number of stomata per cm<sup>2</sup> of a common leaf is about 1000.</p>
        <h2>Structure of Stomata</h2>
        <p>Stomata consist of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guard cells:</strong> These are specialized epidermal cells that are kidney-shaped in dicots and dumb-bell-shaped in monocots. The thickest wall among the inner, outer, and lateral walls of guard cells is the inner wall.</li>
            <li><strong>Subsidiary cells:</strong> These are surrounding cells that support the movement of guard cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chloroplasts are present in the guard cells but are absent in other epidermal cells. However, the chloroplasts in guard cells are capable of poor photosynthesis because there is no RUBP-carboxylase enzyme. Both PS-I and PS-II are present in the chloroplasts of guard cells.</li>
            <li>In the crucifer type of stomata, there are three subsidiary cells.</li>
            <li>Sunken stomata reduce the rate of transpiration.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Types of Stomata</h2>
        <p>Stomata can be classified based on their distribution and light response:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Based on distribution:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Apple or Mulberry type:</em> Stomata are found only on the lower/dorsal surface. Example: Trees</li>
                <li><em>Potato type:</em> Stomata are more common on the lower surface than the upper surface. This is the most common type of stomata and is found in dorsiventral leaves.</li>
                <li><em>Oat type:</em> Stomata are equally distributed on both surfaces. Example: Isobilateral leaves, grasses</li>
                <li><em>Water lily type:</em> Stomata are found only on the upper surface. Example: Free-floating hydrophytes</li>
                <li><em>Potamogeton type:</em> Stomata are absent or vestigial. Example: Submerged hydrophytes</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Based on light response:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Photoactive:</em> Stomata open during the daytime. Example: Usual plants</li>
                <li><em>Scotoactive:</em> Stomata open during the nighttime. Example: Succulent xerophytes (CAM plants) such as Opunita and Bryophyllum</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

                                        <li>Accordingly, stomatal opening and closing mainly depends on activity of enzyme Starch phosphorylase in different pH.

        <h1>A. Mineral nutrition in Plants:</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Green plants prepare their organic food from inorganic substances which they take from soil in the form of minerals, known as mineral elements or mineral nutrients and this nutrition is called mineral nutrition.</li>
		<li>Analysis of plant  ash shows that about 92 mineral elements are present in different plants. Out of these, 30 elements are present in each and every plant. Out of these 30, 16 elements are necessary for plants and are called essential elements, which are as: C, H, O, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, B, Zn, Mn, Mo and Cl.</li>
		<li>Essential elements are divided into 2 main types:
			<ul>
				<li>a. Macro elements/  Major elements: 
					<ul>
						<li>These are required by plants in larger amounts.</li>
						<li>Eg: H, C, N, O, P, S, K, Mg, Ca</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>b. Micro elements/ Minor elements/ Trace elements:
					<ul>
						<li>These are required by plants in very small amounts, i.e., in traces </li>
						<li>Eg: Fe, Cu, B, Zn, Mn, Mo, Cl.</li>
						<li>[The elements having atom no&gt;20 are micro elements except Boron and Chlorine].</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>C, H and O are the non-mineral elements. Plants obtain C in the form of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, H mainly from H<sub>2</sub>O and O is obtained from air or H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
		<li>Tracer elements: These are radioactive isotopes of elements which are used to detect various metabolic pathways in plants. Eg: C<sup>14</sup>,N<sup>15</sup>, P<sup>32</sup>,S<sup>35</sup>, etc</li>
		<li>Critical elements: Critical elements are the elements in which soil is generally deficient. Eg: N, P "and" K. These are given in the form of chemical fertilizer.</li>
		<li>C, H, O(Framework elemetns): They constitute the carbohydrates which form the cell wall.</li>
		<li>Protoplasmic elements: N, P, S form part of protoplasm along with C, H, O.</li>
		<li>Balancing elements: Ca, Mg and K counteracts the toxic effect of other minerals by ion balancing.</li>
		<li>In addition to 16 essential elements, some plants requires some more essential elements. These are
			<ul>
				<li>a. Silica - Found in grasses and diatoms.</li>
				<li>b. Sodium - Found in algae and microbes.</li>
				<li>c. Aluminium - Found in ferns and Lycopodium.</li>
				<li>d. Iodine - Found in marine algae.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Special points:
			<ul>
				<li>a. Molybdenum is the least required micronutrient for the plants.</li>
				<li>b. Nitrogen is derived from both mineral and non-minerals sources.</li>
            </ul>
