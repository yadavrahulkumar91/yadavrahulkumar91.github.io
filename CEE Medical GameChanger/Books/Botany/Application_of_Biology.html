              <h1>Plant Tissue Culture and Gene Transfer</h1>
    <h2>a. Plant tissue culture</h2>
    <p>
      Plant tissue culture is a technique used to produce new plants by growing them
      in a controlled environment outside of their natural habitat. There are
      different types of plant tissue culture, which include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Callus culture</h3>
        <p>
          Callus culture involves the growth of undifferentiated and unorganized
          mass of cells in a culture medium. Callus culture is useful in studying
          the biochemistry and physiology of plants.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Meristem culture</h3>
        <p>
          Meristem culture involves the growth of apical meristem in a culture
          medium. This is useful in producing virus-free plants, as viruses
          cannot infect the apical meristem.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Protoplast culture</h3>
        <p>
          Protoplast culture involves obtaining and culturing individual plant
          cells that have had their cell walls removed. This technique is useful
          in obtaining germ-free plants, introducing foreign genes, and fusing
          incompatible plants.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Root tip culture</h4>
            <p>
              Root tip culture is useful in studying mitosis in plants.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Callus</h4>
            <p>
              Callus is the unorganized and undifferentiated mass of cells in
              tissue culture.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Androgenesis</h4>
            <p>
              Androgenesis is the process of obtaining haploid plants from anther
              or microspore culture. Haploids are useful in plant breeding to
              produce homozygous diploids by colchicine treatment.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>b. Gene transfer</h2>
    <p>
      Gene transfer involves inserting foreign genes of interest into other
      plants. There are different methods of gene transfer, which include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Direct gene transfer</h3>
        <p>
          Direct gene transfer involves transferring foreign genes directly into
          plants by conventional breeding, protoplast fusion, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer technology</h3>
        <p>
          Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer technology involves transferring
          genes from a plant to other plants through Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Genetic Engineering</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Also known as recombinant DNA technology. [MOE 08]</li>
      <li>It is the science which deals with transferring small portions of chromosomes (genes) to get desirable permanent changes in organisms.</li>
      <li>CLONING OF DNA
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Firstly, the DNA of an organism containing the gene of interest is cut into smaller pieces. This gene is called target gene or foreign DNA.</li>
          <li>Secondly, the target gene is joined (in vitro) to a second piece of DNA called vector or cloning vehicle.</li>
          <li>Heresant of joining is a hybrid molecule called hybrid or recombinant DNA, which when introduced into a living cell, replicates into multiple copies.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Major types of vectors
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Plasmids: They are extrachromosomal circular piece of DNA found in bacteria.</li>
          <li>Cosmids: Plasmids which contain a fragment of DNA including (cos site are called cosmids. These are excellent tools for cloning large DNA fragments.</li>
          <li>Bacteriophages: They are viruses that infect bacteria. They can also be used as vectors.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Some important tools in genetic engineering
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Exonucleases: These enzymes act on genome and digest the base pairs on 5' or 3' ends of a single stranded DNA.</li>
          <li>Endonucleases: They act on genetic material and cleave the double stranded DNA at point except the ends.</li>
          <li>Restriction endonucleases/molecular scissors/genetic scalpels
            <ol type="i">
              <li>These enzymes occur naturally in bacteria.</li>
              <li>These enzymes cleave the double stranded DNA into smaller fragments.</li>
              <li>Restriction endonucleases are named after the bacteria from which they are derived. The best known example is EcoR1.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>DNA ligase: DNA ligase is used to covalently link the 3' -hydroxyl end of one strand of DNA to the 5'-phosphate ends of second strand. So, DNA segments cut by restriction endonucleases are joined by DNA ligase enzyme.</li>
          <li>Special points:
            <ul>
              <li>Animals that have foreign genes inserted into their germ lines are called transgenic.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Tobacco and Tomato are Transgenic crops. [@ T = T = T]
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Recombinant DNA is also called chimeric DNA.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Application of Genetic Engineering</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In field of human health:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Synthesis of vaccines. (Eg: Hepatitis B, Rabies, etc)</li>
          <li>Synthesis of hormones - Human Growth Hormones, Insulin, etc</li>
          <li>Synthesis of interferons and monoclonal antibodies</li>
				<li>Synthesis of antibiotics.</li>
				<li>Diagnosis of important diseases</li>
				<li>Eugenics (Father of eugenics - Galton): It is the science of improvement of human genes.</li>
				<li>Euthenics: It is environmental manipulation of suitable genotypes to produce improved species.</li>
				<li>Genetic counseling, e.g. counseling a couple about genetic diseases that could be present in their children, counseling against consanguineous marriages (because it predisposes to recessive diseases like albinism, phenylketonuria, etc), counseling against late marriages (because late marriages predispose to Down's syndrome).</li>
				<li>Gene therapy e.g. Diabetes</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>In field of agriculture:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Creation of resistant varieties of plants eg. Bacillus thuringiensis has ability to destroy stem-borer pest in rice and maize. Hence, when 'Bt gene' is introduced in rice and maize, they show increased resistance.</li>
				<li>Bio-fertilisation: Eg. by creating plants that can fix nitrogen by introduction of 'nif gene' from nitrogen fixing bacteria to the plants.</li>
				<li>Plant and animal breeding.</li>

    <li>After initial investigations using ordinary laboratory apparatus it is usual to make a pilot plant.</li>
    <li>The fermenter is the tank or vessel in which the process will be carried out.</li>
    <li>There are two types of fermentation process: batch fermentation (or closed system) and continuous process (or open system).</li>
    <li>In batch process, the fermenting organism and nutrients medium are allowed to remain in the fermenting tank till maximum fermenting products are formed.</li>
    <li>In continuous process, a portion of medium is removed and fresh medium is added at regular interval.</li>
    <li>Downstream processing is the name given to the stage after fermentation when desired product is recovered and purified.</li>
    <li>Scale-up is the process of gradually converting a useful industrial fermentation from laboratory scale to production scale.</li>
    <li>Fermentation is of 2 types:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>a. Alcoholic fermentation
        <ul>
          <li>Eg: by Saccharomyces cerevisiae</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>b. Antibiotic fermentation</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <h2>Cheese and Yoghurt</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cheese and yoghurt are the products of fermentation.</li>
    <li>Cheese is prepared by the coagulation of casein and other minor milk proteins (curdling of milk) by an enzyme rennin extracted from calf gastric mucosa.
      <ul>
        <li>Note: But, renin is hormone secreted by kidney.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species are involved in the manufacture of most cheese.</li>
    <li>In cheese manufacture, microorganisms are important in both souring and ripening processes.</li>
    <li>Yoghurt is preserved milk product having a distinct taste and a thick texture than milk.</li>
    <li>Yoghurt is made by fermenting whole milk with a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus lactis and S. thermophilus at 40°C.</li>
    <li>Yoghurt gets its flavour by the accumulation of lactic acid and acetaldehyde.</li>
  </ol>

                    <h2>Antibiotics</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The term 'antibiotic' was coined by Selman A. Waksman who discovered streptomycin.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>He got nobel prize for discovering Streptomyces.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by certain microorganisms that kill or inhibit the growth of other microorganisms.</li>
				<li>Antibiotics constitute a special class of drugs or chemotherapeutic agents, produced by the microbial activity.</li>
				<li>Alexander Fleming extracted penicillin from the fungus Penicillium notatum.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>But, penicillin is commercially produced from Penicillium chrysogenum.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Penicillin is the first antibiotic synthesized.</li>
				<li>Streptomycin is useful against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</li>
				<li>Gram-positive bacteria are usually more sensitive to antibiotics than Gram-negative bacteria.</li>
				<li>Antibiotics inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi.</li>
				<li>Viruses lack the metabolism of their own so antibiotics are ineffective against viruses.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<p>Antibiotics are obtained from actinomycetes (mostly), bacteria and fungi.</p>

        <h1>Antibiotics</h1>
	<p>An antibiotic that acts on a variety of pathogenic organisms is called a <strong>broad spectrum antibiotic</strong>. This can act on both gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria.</p>
	<p>An antibiotic that acts on selected or specific pathogenic organisms is called a <strong>narrow spectrum antibiotic</strong>.</p>

    <h1>5. Vaccines</h1>
		<h2>a. Introduction</h2>
			<p>i. Vaccines are suspensions of killed or modified pathogenic microorganisms or antigens; when injected into an animal, these produce immunity to a particular disease.</p>
			<p>ii. In 1796, the British physician Edward Jenner introduced vaccination with cowpox for the first time.</p>
			<p>iii. The scientific basis of vaccination was established by the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur.</p>
			<p>iv. Louis Pasteur discovered cholera vaccine.</p>
			<p>v. Vaccines produced using genetic engineering can usually be made faster than those manufactured by traditional methods.</p>
			<p>vi. Immunity is the ability of body to resist with diseases.</p>
			<p>vii. Antigen (Ag) is the foreign material that elicits antibody formation.</p>
			<p>viii. Antibody (Ab) is the molecule synthesized by human body in response of foreign substance i.e. antigen. It is also known as immunoglobulin.</p>
			<p>Vaccines contain an antigen composed of a disease causing organisms (attenuated) or a part of such organism. They are used to produce immunity (antibodies] against a particular disease or antigen.</p>


            <h2>Types of Immunity</h2>
		<h3>Natural Immunity:</h3>
			<p>Present in body since birth. Some are derived from mother to fetus via placenta (Immunoglobulin G, i.e. IgG)</p>
		<h3>Artificial Immunity:</h3>
			<p>Acquired after birth or during lifetime. It may be active or passive.</p>
			<h4>Active Immunity:</h4>
				<p>Antibodies (Abs) are produced when antigen enters the body. For example vaccine or immunity against certain diseases after patient suffered from that disease.</p>
			<h4>Passive Immunity:</h4>
				<p>Readymade antibodies are introduced into the body. For example, anti-snake venom.</p>
	<h2>Types of Vaccines</h2>
		<h3>Killed or Inactivated Vaccines:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepared by killing the pathogenic organisms by heat or UV-rays or alcohol or formalin.</li>
				<li>Eg: Typhoid vaccine, Cholera vaccine, Pertusis, Influenza, Rabies, Viral Encephalitis, Hepatitis B, Salk (Injectable Polio)</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Toxoid:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepared by destroying the toxic (virulence) property of toxins produced by organism but retaining its antigenic property.</li>
				<li>Eg. Tetanus, Diphtheria.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Attenuated Living Vaccines:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Pathogen is made weakened and non-virulent.</li>
				<li>Eg: Yellow fever, Oral polio vaccine (Sabin). BCG. Mumps, Measles, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.</li>
				<li>Provide life long immunity.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Antibodies as Vaccines:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Serum containing antibodies against pathogens is used after a person or animal has been exposed to infection.</li>
				<li>Provides artificial passive immunity.</li>
				<li>Eg. Anti-tetanus serum, Anti-rabies serum.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Structural Vaccine:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Vaccine produced from extracted cellular fraction.</li>
				<li>Eg: Hepatitis B vaccine</li>
			</ol>


            <h1>Classification of Vaccine</h1>
            <h2>First Generation Vaccine:</h2>
            <p>Vaccines produced from microbes by conventional technique.</p>
            <h2>Second Generation Vaccine:</h2>
            <p>Vaccine produced by recombinant DNA technology. Eg: Hepatitis B vaccine, Herpes virus vaccine, Pneumonia vaccine.</p>
            <h2>Third Generation Vaccine:</h2>
            <p>Synthetic vaccine by Genetic engineering such as FMD vaccine, Feline leukemia vaccine.</p>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The main difficulty in the development of an anti-AIDS vaccine resides on the extreme variability of the HIV due to mutation.</li>
              <li>Cold chain is the system of storage and transportation of vaccine from site of production upto the site of vaccination by maintaining temperature. Either freezer compartment (for live attenuated vaccine) or cold compartment is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sunlight, heat and antiseptic destroy vaccines.</p>

            <h2>Amniocentesis</h2>
    <p>
      The technique which makes use of amniotic fluid (during gestation) for the detection of prenatal disorders is called as amniocentesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amniocentesis is the extraction of some amniotic fluid from around the foetus by means of slender needle inserted through the abdomen of the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sex of the child and chromosomal abnormalities, if any, can be detected by studying foetal cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foetal sex can be determined by examing cells from the amniotic fluid by looking for Barr bodies and sex chromosomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: If Barr bodies present - Female; If Barr bodies absent - Male.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amniocentesis is the process to determine any hereditary disease in the embryo.

<h2>Test Tube Babies</h2>
<p>
  A relatively recent solution to infertility is in vitro fertilization i.e. fertilization in a laboratory dish.
</p>
<p>
  After viewing through a laparoscopy, a ripen egg is removed from a woman's ovary.
</p>
<p>
  The egg is kept in laboratory culture dish and mixed with sperm from father.
</p>
<p>
  The fertilized egg undergoes cleavage in the laboratory dish and when it reaches the 32-cell stage (blastocyst stage), it is transferred into the mother's uterus for implantation.
</p>
<p>
  A normal baby can be born to such a mother. Such a baby is called a test tube baby.
</p>
<p>
  In vitro fertilization (IVF) technology was first pioneered in humans by Prof. Robert Winston.
</p>
<p>
  The world's first test tube baby, Louise Joy Brown (female), was born in Oldham General Hospital, Lancashire, England on July 25, 1978.
</p>
<p>
  It was devised by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edward.
</p>
<p>
  The first test tube baby of Nepal is Om Maya Tamang, born in OM Hospital and research centre on 20th Falgun 2061.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Surrogate mother is the one who lends her uterus for the implantation of the fertilized egg in case the original mother is unfit for the same.
</p>

<h1> Biofertilizers </h1>
	<p> The fertilizers of biological origin are called biofertilizers. These are the organisms (like bacteria, blue-green algae or fungi) which enrich the soil in nutrients. Some of the important biofertilizers are:</p>
	<h2> Bacteria as biofertilizers </h2>
		<h3> Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Rhizobium leguminosarium bacteria live symbiotically in root nodules of legumes and some non-legumes, which fix atmospheric N2 and hence increase the fertility of soil.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3> Free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Some bacteria like Azotobacter (aerobic), Clostridium (anaerobic], Rhodospirillum, Chromatium (photosynthetic bacteria] are free living nitrogen fixing bacteria of soil, which increase fertility of soil and hence yield of crop plants.</li>
			</ol>
	<h2> Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) as biofertilizers </h2>
		<h3> Free living Nitrogen-fixing blue green algae: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Blue green algae like Nostoc, Anabaena, Aulosira, Tolypothrix, Plectonema are the most common nitrogen fixing organisms, probably with the help of heterocysts.</li>
				<li> In the rice field, Nostoc is the most active nitrogen fixing blue green alga.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3> Symbiotic Nitrogen-fixing blue green algae: </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Anabaena Azollae, Anabaena cycadacae and Nostoc punctaeformae are present symbiotically in leaves Azolla (water fern), Cycas roots and Anthoceros thallus respectively, which fix atmospheric nitrogen.</li>
			</ol>
	<p> Biofertilizers crop is improved by supplementing Phosphate fertilizers. Azolla-Anabaena symbiotic system is the main biofertilizer which is inoculated in rice fields in South-Eastern Asia.</p>


    <h1>Fungi as Biofertilizers</h1>
	<h2>Mycorrhiza</h2>
	<p>It is a symbiotic association of certain fungi with the roots of higher plants.</p>
	<p>It is of two types:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Ectomycorrhiza/Ectotrophic
			<ul>
				<li>Developed mycelia form a mantle on the outer surface of the root and the proximal part of hyphae remains inserted in the root cortex.</li>
				<li>Common on the roots of Pine, Oak, Peach and Eucalyptus.</li>
				<li>It absorbs and stores nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) and calcium in the fungal mantle.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Endomycorrhiza/Endotrophic;
			<ul>
				<li>Fungus lives between the cells of the cortex of the roots and only little mycelia remain on the root surface.</li>
				<li>The fungal hyphae penetrating the cortical cells form swollen vesicles called as arbuscules.</li>
				<li>Also known as VAM (Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae).</li>
				<li>Common with grasses, orchids and cereal crops.</li>
				<li>Important in the phosphate nutrition in plants</li>
				<li>Most common endomycorrhiza is Aspergillus.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

    <h2>f. Fertilizers of the biological origin</h2>
<h3>i. Farmyard manure:</h3>
<p>Consists of mixture of cattle dung and remnant of straw and plant stock fed to cattle.</p>
<h3>ii. Composted manure:</h3>
<p>Consists of rotten vegetables and animal faces.</p>
<h3>iii. Green manure:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Fast growing crops are cultivated and ploughed under to incorporate it into the soil.</li>
  <li>Provide organic matter and nitrogen to soil.</li>
  <li>Eg</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Crotolaria juncea</li>
    <li>Trifolium alexandrium</li>
    <li>Lens culinaris</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h1>9. Tissues and Organ Transplantation</h1>
    <p>Transplantation involves the removal of damaged/injured tissues or organs from the body of a person and their substitution by similar tissues/ organs from a donor.</p>
    <h2>a. Tissue Transplantation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Usually done with skin and part of bone. (Most common type of tissue transplantation).</li>
      <li>Done in serious burn on skin area or where bone have been broken or destroyed by the disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>i. Types of tissue transplantation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Autografts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>One's own tissue is grafted to another part of the body, eg. skin grafts for burn treatment or plastic surgery.</li>
          <li>The most successful transplantation is the autograft because of absence of tissue rejection by body.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Isografts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The donor and recipient are genetically identical, eg. transplantation from a twin brother or sister.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Allografts (Homograft):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Transplant between individuals of same species, but with different genetical background.</li>
          <li>The success of this transplant is moderate; eg. Transplant from one person to another person. Eg: blood transfusion, kidney or cornea transplantation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Xenograft (Heterograft):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Transplant between members of different species.</li>
          <li>This type of transplantation is used primarily as a physiological dressing over serious burn injuries. Eg: from pig to man.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>ii. Tissue rejection:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Transplantation may result in the rejection of transplanted tissues or organs.</li>
      <li>The immune system recognizes the protein in the transplanted tissue or organs as foreign and initiates cellular immunity.</li>
      <li>It is mediated by cellular immunity i.e. T-lymphocyte mediated.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>iii. Remedy for transplant rejection</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Immunosuppressive therapy.</li>
      <li>Tissue matching before surgery.</li>
      <li>Monoclonal bodies against T-cells.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>X-ray irridation of lymph node and bone marrow to inhibit production of WBC.</p>

			<li>i. Complicated organs such as kidney, heart, lungs, etc. is transplanted.</li>
			<li>ii. The first heart transplantation was done by Christian Barnard in 1967.</li>
			<li>iii. The best known example of organ transplantation is that of cornea (keratoplasty).</li>
			<li>iv. Cornea should be removed from dead body within 6 - 12 hours after death during eye donation.</li>
			<li>v. Rejection of a foreign organ by a recipient body is a major problem as it triggers the immune responses in recepient body. So they should use drugs called Immunosuppressants after transplantation.</li>
			<li>vi. Corneal graft:
				<ul>
					<li>1) A corneal graft is carried out when a patient has an eye with good visual potential but impaired vision due to scarred or clouded cornea. The corneal grafts have a much better chance of success than other types of transplant. This is because the healthy cornea has no blood supply, so there is less access for WBCs which bring about rejection of donor tissue.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>10. Immunosuppressive drugs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>a. These drugs are given to recipients to prevent rejection.</li>
			<li>b. The drug cyclosporine, derived from a fungus, prevents rejection of kidney, heart and liver transplants.</li>
			<li>c. Cyclosporine inhibits the activity of helper T cells.</li>
