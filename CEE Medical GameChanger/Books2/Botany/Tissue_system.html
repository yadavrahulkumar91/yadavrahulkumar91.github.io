                <li>It comprises:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> Hypodermis</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>It is usually parenchymatous with abundant intercellular space.</li>
                        <li>Innermost layer of cortex is called as Endodermis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> Endodermis/ Starch sheath:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Endodermis is single layered which separates cortex from stele.</li>
                        <li>Endodermis is a part of extrastelar ground tissue system.</li>
                        <li>The cells of endodermis are</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>barrel-shaped,</li> 
                            <li>without inter-cellular spaces,</li> 
                            <li>living and</li>
                            <li>containing starch.</li>
                            <li>Hence, known as starch sheath.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Radial and tangential wall (but mainly radial wall) of endodermal cells possess thickenings of lignin, suberin and cutin in the form of stripes or Casparian bands.
                          <li> Â® Casparian stripes and passage cells are found in exodermis also.</li>
                       <li> â–¡ Passage cells are present just against protoxylem in root. Sometimes an exodermis is found in the certain type of roots. E.g: Hygroscopic root of epiphytes
        A well developed endodermis is constant feature of roots (not in stem).</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Pericycle</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Single or Few layered
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        In Smilax root (monocot), pericycle is multilayered and sclerenchymatous.
      </li>
      <li>
        In some cases like Sunflower stem, pericycle is heterogenous i.e, composed of both thick walled and thin walled cells.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Thin walled parenchymatous or Rarely thick walled sclerenchymatous cells inside the endodermis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pericycle is present in most of the roots except in roots of parasitic plants and hydrophytes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thick-walled pericycle is mechanical in function whereas thin walled pericycle is storage in function.
  </li>
  <li>
    In dicot root, pericycle can also form Cambium.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Medulla (pith) and medullary rays (pith rays)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    The core of plant axis is occupied by a mass of parenchymatous tissue and called as Medulla or Pith.
  </li>
  <li>
    Medulla radiated out and present between vascular bundle is called as Medullary rays or Pith rays.
  </li>
  <li>
    Medulla helps in storage of food while medullary rays help in lateral transportation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pith is distinct in Dicot stem and Monocot root, scattered in Monocot stem but indistinct in Dicot root.
  </li>
  <li>
    In some monocots, as in Triticum, the central region of the stem is hollow and is called Pith cavity. Pith cavity is seen in Ricinus among dicots
  </li>
  <li>
    Pith is developed in Dicot stem and Monocot root.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conjunctive tissue</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Parenchymatous tissue present between Xylem and Phloem bundles.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Part of ground tissue present outside endodermis is called Cortex and inside endodermis is called as Stele.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Stele includes all tissue inside the endodermis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stele in monocot is atactostele and in dicot is eustele.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Endodermis is absent in monocot stem. Thus, ground tissue of monocot stem is not differentiated into cortex and stele.</h3>

<h3>Undifferentiated ground tissue is met within</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Maize stem
  </li>
  <li>
    Cucurbita stem
  </li>
  <li>
    Sunflower stem
  </li>
  <li>
    Pisum stem
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>III. Vascular tissue system:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Central column of axis(root and stem) is called 'Stele' which is made of number of vascular bundles, which constitutes vascular tissue system.</li>
  <li>Stelar region includes all tissues inside pericycle.</li>
  <li>The vascular bundle is having Xylem, Phloem and Cambium (if present).
    <ul>
      <li>Cambium is a stripe of Primary meristem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vascular bundle is mainly 3 types.
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Radial:
        <ul>
          <li>Xylem and Phloem occur in separate bundles, present in different radii, alternate to each other and equal in number.</li>
          <li>Eg: Roots (Dicot and Monocot both).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Conjoint:
        <ul>
          <li>Xylem and Phloem in same bundle and in same radius. E.g: Stem</li>
          <li>2 types
            <ol type="i">
              <li>Collateral:
                <ul>
                  <li>Phloem lies towards outer side or pericycle and xylem towards the centre or pith.</li>
                  <li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Open - Xylem and Phloem separated by Cambium layer. - Dicot stem</li>
                      <li>Closed - Cambium is absent - Monocot stem</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Conjoint, Collateral and Open - Dicot stem</li>
                  <li>Conjoint, Collateral and Closed - Monocot stem</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Phloem is present on both the sides of xylem.</li>
                  <li>The bundle is always Open.</li>

      <h3>F. Histology of Leaf:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In dicots, leaf lie horizontally and upper part facing sunlight is darker than the lower part. So, known as Dorsiventral leaf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In monocots, leaf lies almost vertically and so all surfaces are equally exposed to sunlight, hence are known as Isobilateral leaf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anatomically, leaves can be divided into upper and lower epidermis, mesophyll and vascular bundle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inverted vascular bundles i.e., xylem in the upper part and phloem in the lower part.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vascular bundles are</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Conjoint,</li>
      <li>Collateral and with Mesarch xylem</li>
    </ol>
