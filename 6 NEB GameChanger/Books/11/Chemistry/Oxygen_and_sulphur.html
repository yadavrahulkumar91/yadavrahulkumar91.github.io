      <h3>9.2.1 Definition of Allotropy and Examples</h3>
      
      <p>Allotropy refers to the existence of an element in two or more different forms, known as allotropes, which have distinct physical and chemical properties. These allotropes have the same chemical composition but differ in the arrangement or bonding of their atoms.</p>
      
      <p>Let's explore a few examples of allotropes:</p>
      
      <h4>Diamond and Graphite (Carbon)</h4>
      <p>Carbon exhibits two well-known allotropes: diamond and graphite. Diamond consists of a three-dimensional network of carbon atoms bonded covalently in a tetrahedral arrangement. It is the hardest known natural substance and has excellent thermal conductivity. In contrast, graphite consists of layers of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It is a soft, black, and slippery material, and it conducts electricity due to the presence of delocalized π electrons.</p>
      
      <h4>Oxygen</h4>
      <p>Oxygen, another element with allotropes, exists predominantly as dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in the Earth's atmosphere. It is a colorless, odorless gas and is essential for sustaining life. However, under certain conditions, oxygen can also exist as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Ozone is a pale blue gas with a pungent odor and plays a crucial role in the absorption of harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the Earth's stratosphere.</p>
      
      <h3>9.2.2 Oxygen: Types of Oxides</h3>
      
      <p>Oxygen forms various oxides, which can be classified into different types based on their acidity or basicity. Let's explore the types of oxides:</p>
      
      <h4>Acidic Oxides</h4>
      <p>Acidic oxides are oxides that react with water to form acids. They typically contain nonmetals and exhibit acidic properties when dissolved in water. For example, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) are acidic oxides. When these oxides dissolve in water, they produce carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid, respectively.</p>
      
      <h4>Basic Oxides</h4>
      <p>Basic oxides are oxides that react with water to form bases. They usually consist of metals and exhibit basic properties when dissolved in water. Examples of basic oxides include sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O), calcium oxide (CaO), and magnesium oxide (MgO). When these oxides dissolve in water, they give rise to sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide, respectively.</p>
      
      <h4>Neutral Oxides</h4>
      <p>Neutral oxides are oxides that do not display acidic or basic properties when dissolved in water. Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) are examples of neutral oxides. These oxides neither react with water to form an acid nor a base.</p>
      
      <h4>Amphoteric Oxides</h4>
      <p>Amphoteric oxides are oxides that can exhibit both acidic and basic properties, depending on the reaction conditions. An example of an amphoteric oxide is aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It reacts with strong acids, behaving as a base, and with strong bases, behaving as an acid.</p>
      
      <h4>Peroxides and Mixed
      
       Oxides</h4>
      <p>Peroxides are oxides that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond (O-O). Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a well-known peroxide. Mixed oxides, on the other hand, are oxides that contain more than one type of element. An example is calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen.</p>
      
      <h3>9.2.3 Applications of Hydrogen Peroxide</h3>
      
      <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has several applications due to its oxidizing and bleaching properties. Here are a few notable applications:</p>

      <h2>9.3 Ozone</h2>
      <h3>9.3.1 Occurrence</h3>
      <p>Ozone (<span style="font-weight:bold;">O<sub>3</sub></span>) is a naturally occurring molecule in the Earth's atmosphere. It is found in small concentrations throughout the atmosphere, with the highest concentration present in the ozone layer, which is located in the stratosphere, approximately 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface.</p>
      <p>Ozone is also present in lower concentrations in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Here, it is formed through various natural processes involving sunlight, oxygen, and certain pollutants.</p>
      <h3>9.3.2 Preparation of Ozone from Oxygen</h3>
      <p>Ozone can be prepared by several methods. One common method is through the silent electric discharge method. In this method, oxygen gas (<span style="font-weight:bold;">O<sub>2</sub></span>) is passed through a high-voltage electric discharge, such as a corona discharge or a dielectric barrier discharge.</p>
      <p>The reaction for the preparation of ozone from oxygen can be represented as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Passing oxygen gas through a high-voltage electric discharge:</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">3O<sub>2</sub></span> → <span style="font-weight:bold;">2O<sub>3</sub></span></p>
      <h3>9.3.3 Structure of Ozone</h3>
      <p>Ozone (<span style="font-weight:bold;">O<sub>3</sub></span>) has a bent or V-shaped structure. It consists of three oxygen atoms bonded together, with one central oxygen atom bonded to the other two by double bonds. This arrangement gives ozone its unique properties and reactivity.</p>
      <h3>9.3.4 Test for Ozone</h3>
      <p>Ozone can be tested using potassium iodide (KI) solution. When ozone reacts with potassium iodide, it oxidizes iodide ions to form iodine. The presence of iodine can be detected by its characteristic brown color:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reaction between ozone and potassium iodide:</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">2KI + O<sub>3</sub></span> → <span style="font-weight:bold;">2KIO<sub>3</sub></span> + I<sub>2</sub></p>
      <h3>9.3.5 Ozone Layer Depletion (Causes, Effects, and Control Measures)</h3>
      <p>Ozone layer depletion refers to the thinning of the ozone layer in the stratosphere due to the release of certain chemicals into the atmosphere. The primary cause of ozone layer depletion is the release of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and carbon tetrachloride.</p>
      <p>The depletion of the ozone layer has several negative effects on the environment and human health. It leads to increased levels of harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and damage to marine ecosystems.</p>
      <p>To control and prevent further ozone layer depletion, international agreements like the Montreal Protocol have been established. The Montreal Protocol aims to phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances and has been successful in reducing their levels in the atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>9.3.6 Uses of Ozone</h3>
      <p>Ozone has various applications due to its strong oxidizing properties and disinfectant properties. Some common uses of ozone include:</p>
