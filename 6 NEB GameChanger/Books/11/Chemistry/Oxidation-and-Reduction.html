      <h2>6.1 General and Electronic Concept of Oxidation and Reduction</h2>
  <p>
    Oxidation and reduction are fundamental processes in chemistry that involve the transfer of electrons between species. These processes can be understood from both a general and an electronic perspective.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the general concept, oxidation refers to the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an element, while reduction refers to the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of an element.
  </p>

  <p>
    From an electronic concept, oxidation involves the removal of electrons from an atom or ion, resulting in an increase in positive charge. Reduction, on the other hand, involves the addition of electrons to an atom or ion, resulting in a decrease in positive charge.
  </p>

  <h2>6.2 Oxidation Number and Rules for Assigning Oxidation Number</h2>
  <p>
    The oxidation number is a concept used to track the electron distribution in a compound or ion. It represents the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if electrons were transferred completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rules for assigning oxidation numbers include:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The oxidation number of an element in its free (uncombined) state is zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to its charge.
    </li>
    <li>
      The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is -2, except in peroxides (where it is -1) and when bonded to fluorine (where it is positive).
    </li>
    <li>
      The oxidation number of hydrogen in most compounds is +1, except in metal hydrides (where it is -1).
    </li>
    <li>
      The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero, and the sum of oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to its charge.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>6.3 Balancing Redox Reactions by Oxidation Number and Ion-Electron (Half Reaction) Method</h2>
  <p>
    Redox reactions involve both oxidation and reduction processes. Balancing these reactions requires ensuring that the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction equals the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two methods for balancing redox reactions: the oxidation number method and the ion-electron (half reaction) method.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the oxidation number method, the oxidation numbers of elements are assigned and used to determine the change in oxidation numbers. The reactions are balanced by adding coefficients to ensure that the total increase in oxidation numbers equals the total decrease.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the ion-electron method, the reaction is separated into two half-reactions: the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction. Each half-reaction is balanced individually by balancing the atoms and charges. The half-reactions are then combined, ensuring that the electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction are equal to the electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    These methods allow us to balance redox reactions and determine the stoichiometry of species involved, facilitating the understanding of chemical transformations and their applications.
  </p>

  
  <h2>6.4 Electrolysis</h2>

  <h3>6.4.1 Qualitative Aspect</h3>
  <p>
    Electrolysis is a process that involves the decomposition of an electrolyte by passing an electric current through it. The electrolyte is a compound that conducts electricity when dissolved in a solvent or when molten. During electrolysis, the positive ions (cations) move towards the negative electrode (cathode) and the negative ions (anions) move towards the positive electrode (anode).
  </p>

  <p>
    Qualitatively, electrolysis can result in various observations and outcomes, such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Formation of bubbles at the electrodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change in color of the electrolyte or electrodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deposition of a metal at the cathode (reduction) or liberation of a gas at the anode (oxidation).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.4.2 Quantitative Aspect (Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis)</h3>
  <p>
    Faraday's laws of electrolysis provide a quantitative understanding of electrolysis based on the amount of substance involved and the passage of electric charge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faraday's First Law states that the mass of a substance deposited or liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte. It can be expressed using the equation:
  </p>

  <p>
    Mass of Substance (m) = Equivalent Mass (E) x Quantity of Electricity (Q)
  </p>

  <p>
    Faraday's Second Law states that the masses of different substances deposited or liberated by the same quantity of electricity are directly proportional to their chemical equivalent masses. It can be expressed using the equation:
  </p>

  <p>
    Ratio of Masses (m1 / m2) = Ratio of Equivalent Masses (E1 / E2)
  </p>

  <p>
    Faraday's laws help in understanding the stoichiometry of electrolytic reactions and in calculating the quantities of substances involved in electrolysis.
