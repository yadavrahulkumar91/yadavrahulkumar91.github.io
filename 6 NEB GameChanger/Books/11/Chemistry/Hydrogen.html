        <h2>9.1 Hydrogen</h2>

        <h3>9.1.1 Chemistry of Atomic and Nascent Hydrogen</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe. It exists in various forms, including atomic and nascent hydrogen.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Atomic hydrogen refers to the diatomic molecule H<sub>2</sub>. It is a colorless, odorless, and highly flammable gas. Atomic hydrogen plays a crucial role in various chemical reactions, such as hydrogenation and reduction processes.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Nascent hydrogen refers to hydrogen in its reactive state, immediately after its formation. It is highly reactive and exhibits different chemical properties compared to stable molecular hydrogen. Nascent hydrogen is often involved in redox reactions and acts as a reducing agent.
        </p>
      
        <h3>9.1.2 Isotopes of Hydrogen and Their Uses</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium (H-1), deuterium (H-2), and tritium (H-3). Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Protium is the most abundant and stable isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium is a stable isotope with one neutron, and tritium is a radioactive isotope with two neutrons. The isotopes of hydrogen have different properties and find various applications in research, industry, and medicine.
        </p>
      
        <h3>9.1.3 Application of Hydrogen as Fuel</h3>
        <p>
          Hydrogen is considered a clean and sustainable fuel source. It can be used in fuel cells to produce electricity through electrochemical reactions. Hydrogen fuel cells have applications in transportation, including cars and buses, as well as stationary power generation.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The combustion of hydrogen as a fuel produces only water vapor, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, challenges related to hydrogen storage and infrastructure need to be addressed for widespread adoption.
        </p>
      
        <h3>9.1.4 Heavy Water and Its Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Heavy water, also known as deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O), is a form of water in which the hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms. Deuterium is a stable isotope of hydrogen with one neutron.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Heavy water has various applications, including its use as a moderator in nuclear reactors, where it slows down neutrons to sustain a controlled nuclear reaction. It is also used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and as a tracer in scientific research.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Heavy water plays a crucial role in studying biochemical reactions and understanding the behavior of biological molecules.
