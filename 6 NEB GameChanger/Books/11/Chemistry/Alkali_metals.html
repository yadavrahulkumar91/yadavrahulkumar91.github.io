      <h1>10.2 Alkali Metals</h1>
      
      <h2>10.2.1 General Characteristics of Alkali Metals</h2>
      
      <p>Alkali metals are a group of elements found in Group 1 of the periodic table, which includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). They share several general characteristics:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>They are highly reactive metals.</li>
        <li>They have low density and are relatively soft.</li>
        <li>They have low melting and boiling points.</li>
        <li>They are excellent conductors of heat and electricity.</li>
        <li>They have a single valence electron, making them prone to losing that electron and forming a univalent cation with a +1 charge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Extraction from Down's Process:</h3>
      
      <p>Sodium is commonly extracted from its chief ore, sodium chloride (NaCl), through an electrolytic process known as Down's process.

      <p>During electrolysis, sodium ions migrate towards the cathode, where they are reduced to sodium metal:</p>
      
      \[2Na^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Na\]
