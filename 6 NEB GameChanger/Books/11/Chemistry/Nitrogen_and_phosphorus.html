      <h1>9.4 Nitrogen</h1>
      
      <h2>9.4.1 Reason for Inertness of Nitrogen and Active Nitrogen</h2>
      
      <p>Nitrogen is an element found abundantly in the Earth's atmosphere, constituting about 78% of the air we breathe. It exists as a diatomic molecule, N<sub>2</sub>, where two nitrogen atoms are triple-bonded together. The inertness of nitrogen is primarily attributed to the strength of this triple bond.</p>
      
      <p>The triple bond in N<sub>2</sub> is exceptionally strong, requiring a significant amount of energy to break it. This makes nitrogen unreactive under normal conditions. The inertness of nitrogen allows it to act as a diluent gas, providing stability and reducing the reactivity of other substances.</p>
      
      <p>However, despite being generally unreactive, nitrogen can form compounds under specific conditions. Active nitrogen refers to the highly reactive forms of nitrogen, such as nitrogen radicals or ions, which are capable of participating in chemical reactions. These reactive forms of nitrogen can be generated through processes like lightning, combustion, or certain industrial reactions.</p>
      
      <h2>9.4.2 Chemical Properties of Ammonia</h2>
      
      <p>Ammonia, represented by the chemical formula NH<sub>3</sub>, is a compound composed of one nitrogen atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It exhibits several chemical properties, as described below:</p>
      
      <h3>Action with CuSO<sub>4</sub> Solution:</h3>
      
      <p>When ammonia reacts with copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) solution, it forms a deep blue complex known as tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate:</p>
      
      \[CuSO_4 + 4NH_3 \rightarrow [Cu(NH_3)_4]SO_4\]
      
      <h3>Action with Water:</h3>
      
      <p>Ammonia can act as a weak base in the presence of water. It undergoes a reversible reaction with water, forming ammonium ions (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>):</p>
      
      \[NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+ + OH^-\]
      
      <h3>Action with FeCl<sub>3</sub> Solution:</h3>
      
      <p>Ammonia reacts with ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) solution, forming a deep red-brown complex called hexaammineferric chloride:</p>
      
      \[FeCl_3 + 6NH_3 \rightarrow [Fe(NH_3)_6]Cl_3\]
      
      <h3>Action with Concentrated HCl:</h3>
      
      <p>Ammonia reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form a white precipitate of ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl):</p>
      
      \[NH_3 + HCl \rightarrow NH_4Cl\]
      
      <h3>Action with Mercurous Nitrate Paper:</h3>
      
      <p>Ammonia gas, when brought in contact with mercurous nitrate paper, causes the paper to turn black due to the formation of a gray-black compound called mercurous ammonium nitrate:</p>
      
      \[Hg(NO_3)_2 + 2NH_3 \rightarrow Hg + NH_4NO_3 + H_2O\]
      
      <h3>Action with
      
       Oxygen (Combustion):</h3>
      
      <p>Ammonia can undergo combustion in the presence of oxygen to produce nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O):</p>
      
      \[4NH_3 + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2N_2 + 6H_2O\]

      <h2>9.4.7 Ring Test for Nitrate Ion</h2>
      
      <p>The ring test is a simple qualitative test used to detect the presence of the nitrate ion (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Here's how the test is conducted:</p>
      
      <ol>
