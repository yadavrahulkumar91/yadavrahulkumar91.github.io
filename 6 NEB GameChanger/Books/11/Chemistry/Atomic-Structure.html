        <h1>3.1 Rutherford's Atomic Model</h1>

        <p>
            Rutherford's atomic model, proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, revolutionized our understanding of the structure of atoms. It was based on the results of the famous gold foil experiment conducted by Rutherford and his colleagues.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            According to Rutherford's atomic model:
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                The atom is mostly empty space with a tiny, dense, and positively charged nucleus at its center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Electrons are negatively charged particles that revolve around the nucleus in specific orbits or energy levels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
            The model provided a solution to the problem of why negatively charged electrons do not simply fall into the positively charged nucleus, as predicted by classical physics. It proposed that the electrons have a stable orbit around the nucleus due to the balance of attractive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Rutherford's atomic model laid the foundation for further discoveries in atomic structure and led to the development of quantum mechanics, which provides a more detailed and accurate description of atomic behavior.

        <h1>3.2 Limitations of Rutherford's Atomic Model</h1>
    
        <p>
            While Rutherford's atomic model was groundbreaking, it had certain limitations that subsequent experiments and theories revealed:
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                The model failed to explain the stability of atoms. According to classical electromagnetic theory, accelerating charged particles lose energy in the form of radiation and should eventually spiral into the nucleus. However, stable atoms exist, indicating that there must be some other mechanism at play.
            </li>
            <li>
                The model couldn't explain the observed line spectra of different elements. Rutherford's model predicted a continuous spectrum, but experimental evidence showed that each element emitted or absorbed light at specific wavelengths, forming a unique line spectrum.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rutherford's model didn't account for the wave-like behavior of electrons. Subsequent discoveries, such as the wave-particle duality of electrons, revealed that electrons exhibit both particle and wave properties. This behavior couldn't be explained by the strictly classical model proposed by Rutherford.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h1>3.3 Postulates of Bohr's Atomic Model and Its Application</h1>

            <p>
                Bohr's atomic model, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, built upon Rutherford's model and introduced the concept of quantized energy levels in atoms. It successfully explained the stability of atoms and the observed line spectra of elements. The postulates of Bohr's atomic model are as follows:
            </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular orbits at specific energy levels, also called stationary states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Electrons can only occupy certain allowed energy levels. These energy levels are quantized, meaning they have fixed energies. Electrons can transition between energy levels by absorbing or emitting energy in the form of photons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Electrons in the lowest energy level, called the ground state, are more stable and less energetic compared to electrons in higher energy levels, known as excited states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. This emission results in the observed line spectra of elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The angular momentum of an electron in an orbit is quantized and can only take certain discrete values. This quantization is given by the equation:
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">
                        \(mvr = \dfrac{nh}{2\pi}\)
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    where \(m\) is the mass of the electron, \(v\) is its velocity, \(r\) is the radius of the orbit, \(n\) is an integer representing the energy level, and \(h\) is the Planck's constant.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>
                The application of Bohr's atomic model has been instrumental in understanding various phenomena, including the following:
            </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explanation of Line Spectra:</strong> Bohr's model successfully explained the observed line spectra of elements. Each element emits or absorbs light at specific wavelengths due to the quantized energy levels and the transitions of electrons between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prediction of Energy Levels:</strong> Bohr's model predicted the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms, which were later confirmed by experimental observations. These energy levels played a crucial role in understanding and calculating various atomic properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explanation of Ionization:</strong> Bohr's model provided insights into the ionization of atoms. When an electron absorbs sufficient energy, it can transition from the ground state to a higher energy level or even be completely removed from the atom, resulting in ionization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Calculation of Atomic Radii:</strong> By considering the balance between the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the electron and the centrifugal force acting on the electron, Bohr's model allowed the estimation of atomic radii for hydrogen-like species.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>
                Bohr's atomic model played a significant role in bridging classical and quantum physics, paving the way for further developments in atomic theory and the eventual formulation of more comprehensive quantum mechanical models.

            <h1>3.4 Spectrum of Hydrogen Atom</h1>

            <p>
                The spectrum of the hydrogen atom refers to the characteristic patterns of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen gas when its electrons undergo transitions between different energy levels. This phenomenon is explained by Bohr's atomic model and the concept of quantized energy levels. The spectrum of the hydrogen atom consists of various series of spectral lines, including the Balmer series, Lyman series, and Paschen series.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>Balmer Series:</strong> The Balmer series corresponds to electron transitions in hydrogen where the electron starts or ends in the second energy level (n = 2). The Balmer series lies in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is represented by the formula:
            </p>
        
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                \( \dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \dfrac{1}{2^2} - \dfrac{1}{n^2} \right) \)
            </p>
        
            <p>
                where \( \lambda \) represents the wavelength of the spectral line, \( R_H \) is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, and \( n \) is an integer representing the energy level of the electron.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>Lyman Series:</strong> The Lyman series corresponds to electron transitions in hydrogen where the electron starts or ends in the first energy level (n = 1). The Lyman series lies in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is given by the equation:
            </p>
        
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                \( \dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \dfrac{1}{1^2} - \dfrac{1}{n^2} \right) \)
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>Paschen Series:</strong> The Paschen series corresponds to electron transitions in hydrogen where the electron starts or ends in the third energy level (n = 3). The Paschen series lies in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum and is represented by the formula:
            </p>
        
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                \( \dfrac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left( \dfrac{1}{3^2} - \dfrac{1}{n^2} \right) \)
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The spectrum of the hydrogen atom, with its characteristic series of spectral lines, provided crucial evidence for the validity of Bohr's atomic model and its postulates regarding quantized energy levels and electron transitions.

            <h1>3.5 Defects of Bohr's Theory</h1>
        
            <p>
                While Bohr's atomic model was a significant advancement in atomic theory, it had several limitations and defects that were later addressed by more comprehensive quantum mechanical models. Some of the notable defects of Bohr's theory include:
            </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limited Applicability:</strong> Bohr's model was primarily applicable to hydrogen-like species, where only one electron was present. It failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for multi-electron atoms and their complex spectral patterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Violation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:</strong> Bohr's model suggested that electrons move in well-defined orbits with known positions and velocities. However, this concept violated Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously determine the precise position and momentum of a particle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Failure to Explain Chemical Bonding:</strong> Bohr's model did not account for the formation of chemical bonds between atoms or the molecular structure of compounds. It focused primarily on the behavior of individual atoms and their electronic transitions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ignored Electron Spin:</strong> Bohr's model did not incorporate the concept of electron spin, which was later discovered and found to be essential in explaining various phenomena, including the properties of magnetic materials and the Pauli exclusion principle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Energy Levels without Justification:</strong> While Bohr's model successfully predicted the energy levels of hydrogen, it couldn't provide a theoretical justification for the existence of these specific energy levels or explain why only certain values were allowed.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>
                Despite its defects, Bohr's atomic model laid the foundation for further advancements in quantum mechanics and atomic theory. It played a crucial role in inspiring subsequent researchers to develop more comprehensive models that could explain a wider range of atomic phenomena.

            <h1>3.6 Elementary Idea of Quantum Mechanical Model: de Broglie's Wave Equation</h1>

            <p>
                In the early 20th century, Louis de Broglie proposed a revolutionary concept that particles, such as electrons and other subatomic particles, exhibit wave-like properties. This idea laid the foundation for the development of the quantum mechanical model of the atom. de Broglie's wave equation relates the wavelength (\( \lambda \)) of a particle to its momentum (\( p \)) and Planck's constant (\( h \)):
            </p>
        
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                \( \lambda = \dfrac{h}{p} \)
            </p>
        
            <p>
                where \( \lambda \) represents the wavelength, \( p \) is the momentum of the particle, and \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} \)). This equation implies that particles, including electrons, can exhibit wave-like behavior and possess both particle and wave properties.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                de Broglie's wave equation suggests that particles, previously thought to be purely particles with well-defined positions and velocities, also exhibit wave-like characteristics. It introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior depending on the experimental conditions.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                In the context of the quantum mechanical model of the atom, de Broglie's wave equation provided a theoretical basis for understanding the quantized energy levels and electron orbits proposed by Bohr. It also played a crucial role in the development of wave mechanics and the formulation of Schrödinger's wave equation, which provided a more comprehensive description of the behavior of subatomic particles.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                de Broglie's wave equation remains a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics and has profound implications for our understanding of the microscopic world.
            </p>



   <h1>3.7 Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</h1>

    <p>
        Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that sets limits on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be simultaneously known. The principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \dfrac{h}{4\pi} \)
    </p>

    <p>
        where \( \Delta x \) represents the uncertainty in position, \( \Delta p \) represents the uncertainty in momentum, and \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js} \)).
    </p>

    <p>
        Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle implies that there are inherent limits to the precision with which certain pairs of complementary properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously determined. This principle challenges the classical notion of particles having well-defined positions and velocities and emphasizes the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Uncertainty Principle has profound implications for our understanding of the microscopic world. It suggests that there are fundamental limits to the predictability of subatomic particles and that the act of measurement itself can disturb the system being observed.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h1>3.8 Concept of Probability</h1>

    <p>
        Probability is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that is used to describe the behavior of particles and systems at the microscopic level. In the context of quantum mechanics, the probability of an event is related to the wave function of a particle or system.
    </p>

    <p>
        In quantum mechanics, the wave function (\( \Psi \)) describes the state of a particle or system and contains information about its properties. The probability of finding the particle in a particular state or at a specific location is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function (\( |\Psi|^2 \)) at that location. Mathematically, this is represented as:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( P = |\Psi|^2 \)
    </p>

    <p>
        where \( P \) represents the probability and \( \Psi \) is the wave function.
    </p>

    <p>
        The concept of probability in quantum mechanics emphasizes the probabilistic nature of the microscopic world. It suggests that the behavior of particles and systems is inherently uncertain and can only be described in terms of probabilities. This probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics is fundamentally different from classical physics, where properties are considered to have well-defined values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Probability plays a crucial role in understanding and predicting various phenomena in quantum mechanics, including the distribution of particles in energy levels, the outcomes of measurements, and the behavior of quantum systems in superposition and entanglement.
    </p>


    <h1>3.9 Quantum Numbers</h1>

    <p>
        Quantum numbers are a set of parameters used to describe the unique properties and characteristics of electrons in an atom. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the distribution of electrons in different energy levels, subshells, and orbitals within an atom. The four quantum numbers used in the description of electrons are:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Principal Quantum Number (n):</strong> The principal quantum number defines the energy level or shell in which an electron resides. It can have integer values of 1, 2, 3, and so on, representing the successive energy levels farther from the nucleus.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Azimuthal Quantum Number (l):</strong> The azimuthal quantum number determines the shape of the orbital and the subshell to which an electron belongs. It can have integer values from 0 to \( n-1 \), representing different subshells within an energy level. For example, when \( n = 2 \), \( l \) can be 0 or 1, representing the s and p subshells, respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Magnetic Quantum Number (m<sub>l</sub>):</strong> The magnetic quantum number specifies the orientation of the orbital in space. It can have integer values ranging from -\( l \) to \( l \), representing the different spatial orientations of the orbitals within a subshell.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Spin Quantum Number (m<sub>s</sub>):</strong> The spin quantum number describes the intrinsic spin of an electron. It can have two possible values: +\( \frac{1}{2} \) (spin-up) or -\( \frac{1}{2} \) (spin-down).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Quantum numbers play a crucial role in determining the electron configuration of atoms, the arrangement of electrons in orbitals, and the overall behavior of electrons within the atom.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h1>3.10 Orbitals and Shape of s and p Orbitals</h1>

    <p>
        Orbitals are regions of space around the nucleus where electrons are most likely to be found. They are described by the quantum numbers and are characterized by their shape and orientation. The two most common types of orbitals are s and p orbitals.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>s Orbitals:</strong> s orbitals are spherical in shape and symmetric with respect to the nucleus. They have a single lobe and no nodal planes. The principal quantum number (n) determines the size of the s orbital, with higher values of n corresponding to larger orbitals. The s orbitals are designated as 1s, 2s, 3s, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>p Orbitals:</strong> p orbitals have a dumbbell-like shape with two lobes of opposite sign and a nodal plane between them. There are three p orbitals, designated as px, py, and pz, representing different spatial orientations along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. The p orbitals exist in sets of three for each energy level beyond the first shell (n > 1).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="s-p-orbitals.png" alt="s and p orbitals" width="400px">
    </p>

    <p>
        The shape and orientation of s and p orbitals provide insights into the distribution of electron density in atoms and molecules. These orbitals, along with d and f orbitals, contribute to the overall electronic structure and chemical behavior of elements.
    </p>

    <h1>3.11 Aufbau Principle</h1>

    <p>
        The Aufbau Principle, also known as the building-up principle, is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the order in which electrons fill atomic orbitals. According to the Aufbau Principle, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first before moving to higher energy orbitals. This principle is based on the idea that electrons seek the most stable arrangement, which corresponds to filling the available orbitals in increasing order of their energy levels.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Aufbau Principle provides a systematic approach to determine the electron configuration of atoms and predict the order in which the orbitals are filled. It helps in understanding the periodic table and the organization of elements based on their electron configurations and chemical properties.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h1>3.12 Pauli's Exclusion Principle</h1>

    <p>
        Pauli's Exclusion Principle, formulated by Wolfgang Pauli, states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. In other words, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle arises from the quantum mechanical property of electrons known as spin.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to Pauli's Exclusion Principle, each orbital can accommodate a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. The spin quantum number (m<sub>s</sub>) for one electron is +\( \frac{1}{2} \) (spin-up), and for the other electron in the same orbital, it is -\( \frac{1}{2} \) (spin-down). This principle ensures the stability of atoms and prevents electron-electron repulsion within the same orbital.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h1>3.13 Hund's Rule and Electronic Configurations of Atoms and Ions (up to Atomic No. 30)</h1>

    <p>
        Hund's Rule provides a guideline for filling orbitals with electrons when multiple orbitals of the same energy level (degenerate orbitals) are available. According to Hund's Rule:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Electrons occupy degenerate orbitals singly with parallel spins before pairing up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (parallel spins) to maximize the total electron spin.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Using the principles of Aufbau, Pauli's Exclusion, and Hund's Rule, we can determine the electronic configurations of atoms and ions. Here are the electronic configurations for elements up to atomic number 30 (Z = 30):
