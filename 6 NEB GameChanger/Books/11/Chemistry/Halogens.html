      <h2>9.5 Halogens</h2>
      
      <h3>9.5.1 General Characteristics of Halogens</h3>
      <p>Halogens are a group of nonmetallic elements that belong to Group 17 (Group VIIA) of the periodic table. The halogen group consists of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). In this chapter, we will focus on the three most common halogens: chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).</p>
      
      <h3>9.5.2 Comparative Study on Preparation of Halogens</h3>
      <p>The preparation methods for halogens involve various chemical reactions, but detailed diagrams and descriptions are not required for this section.</p>
      
      <h4>9.5.2.1 Chemical Properties of Halogens</h4>
      <p>Halogens exhibit several chemical properties, including their reactions with water, alkalis, ammonia, their oxidizing character, and bleaching action. Let's explore these properties for chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2):</p>
      
      <h5>Reactions with Water:</h5>
      <p>Chlorine reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO), which is a weak acid.</p>
      <p>$$\text{Cl}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{HCl} + \text{HClO}$$</p>
      <p>Bromine reacts with water to form hydrobromic acid (HBr) and hypobromous acid (HBrO), which are also weak acids.</p>
      <p>$$\text{Br}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{HBr} + \text{HBrO}$$</p>
      <p>Iodine reacts slowly with water to form hydriodic acid (HI) and hypoiodous acid (HIO), which are weak acids as well.</p>
      <p>$$\text{I}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{HI} + \text{HIO}$$</p>
      
      <h5>Reactions with Alkalis:</h5>
      <p>Chlorine reacts with alkalis, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO).</p>
      <p>$$\text{Cl}_2 + 2\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{NaCl} + \text{NaClO} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$</p>
      <p>Bromine reacts with alkalis to form sodium bromide (NaBr) and sodium hypobromite (NaBrO).</p>
      <p>$$\text{Br}_2 + 2\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{NaBr} + \text{NaBrO} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$</p>
      <p>Iodine does not react directly with alkalis under normal conditions.</p>
      
      <h5>Reactions with Ammonia:</h5>
      <p>Chlorine reacts with ammonia (NH3) to form ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and nitrogen trichloride (NCl3).</p>
      <p>$$\text{Cl}_2 + 8
      
      \text{NH}_3 \rightarrow 6\text{NH}_4\text{Cl} + \text{NCl}_3$$</p>
      <p>Bromine reacts with ammonia to form ammonium bromide (NH4Br) and nitrogen tribromide (NBr3).</p>
      <p>$$\text{Br}_2 + 6\text{NH}_3 \rightarrow 3\text{NH}_4\text{Br} + \text{NBr}_3$$</p>
      <p>Iodine reacts with ammonia to form ammonium iodide (NH4I) and nitrogen triiodide (NI3).</p>
      <p>$$\text{I}_2 + 6\text{NH}_3 \rightarrow 3\text{NH}_4\text{I} + \text{NI}_3$$</p>
      
      <h5>Oxidizing Character:</h5>
      <p>Halogens are powerful oxidizing agents. They readily accept electrons to form negative ions. For example, chlorine can oxidize ferrous ions (Fe2+) to ferric ions (Fe3+).</p>
      <p>$$\text{Cl}_2 + 2\text{Fe}^{2+} \rightarrow 2\text{Cl}^- + 2\text{Fe}^{3+}$$</p>
      
      <h5>Bleaching Action:</h5>
      <p>Chlorine and bromine exhibit bleaching action, which is the ability to remove color from substances. They achieve this by breaking down colored compounds through oxidation. For example, chlorine can bleach colored dyes by oxidizing them.</p>
      
      <h4>Uses of Halogens (Cl2, Br2, and I2)</h4>
      <p>The halogens find various applications in different fields. Here are some common uses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chlorine (Cl2) is widely used in water treatment to disinfect and kill bacteria and other pathogens.</li>
        <li>It is used in the production of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), a versatile plastic.</li>
        <li>Bromine (Br2) is used in the production of flame retardants, which are added to materials to reduce their flammability.</li>
        <li>Iodine (I2) is used in medicine as an antiseptic and as a disinfectant for wounds.</li>
        <li>It is also used in the production of iodized salt, which helps prevent iodine deficiency disorders.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>9.5.3 Test for Cl2, Br2, and I2</h3>
      <p>There are specific tests to identify the presence of chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2) in a given sample:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chlorine: Chlorine gas turns moist litmus paper red then bleaches it, turning it white.</li>
        <li>Bromine: Bromine water turns colorless organic compounds, such as cyclohexane, from colorless to orange/red.</li>
        <li>Iodine: Iodine solution (potassium iodide solution) reacts with starch to form a blue-black color.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>9.5.4 Comparative Study on Preparation, Properties, and Uses of Haloacids (HCl, HBr, and HI)</h3>
      <p>Haloacids are a group of acids formed by combining a halogen with hydrogen. Let's compare the preparation methods, properties, and uses of three common haloacids: hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic
      
       acid (HBr), and hydroiodic acid (HI).</p>
      
      <h4>Preparation:</h4>
      <p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is prepared by dissolving hydrogen chloride gas in water.</p>
      <p>$$\text{HCl(g)} + \text{H}_2\text{O(l)} \rightarrow \text{HCl(aq)}$$</p>
      <p>Hydrobromic acid (HBr) is prepared by dissolving hydrogen bromide gas in water.</p>
      <p>$$\text{HBr(g)} + \text{H}_2\text{O(l)} \rightarrow \text{HBr(aq)}$$</p>
      <p>Hydroiodic acid (HI) is prepared by dissolving hydrogen iodide gas in water.</p>
      <p>$$\text{HI(g)} + \text{H}_2\text{O(l)} \rightarrow \text{HI(aq)}$$</p>
      
      <h4>Properties:</h4>
      <p>Reducing Strength: Hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), and hydroiodic acid (HI) are all strong reducing agents, but their reducing strength increases down the group. This means that HI is the strongest reducing agent among the three.</p>
      <p>Acidic Nature: All three haloacids are strong acids, but their acidity also increases down the group. This means that HI is the strongest acid among the three.</p>
      <p>Solubility: Hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), and hydroiodic acid (HI) are all soluble in water.</p>
      
      <h4>Uses:</h4>
      <p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used in the production of various chemicals, such as PVC, dyes, and fertilizers. It is also used in the food industry for pH control.</p>
      <p>Hydrobromic acid (HBr) finds applications in organic synthesis and as a reagent in chemical reactions.</p>
      <p>Hydroiodic acid (HI) is used in organic synthesis and as a reducing agent in chemical reactions.</p>
