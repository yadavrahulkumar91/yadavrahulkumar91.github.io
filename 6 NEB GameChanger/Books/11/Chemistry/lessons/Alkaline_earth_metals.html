      <h2>10.3 Alkaline Earth Metals</h2>
      
      <h3>10.3.1 General Characteristics of Alkaline Earth Metals</h3>
      <p>Alkaline earth metals are a group of metallic elements that belong to Group 2 (Group IIA) of the periodic table. The alkaline earth metal group consists of beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra). In this chapter, we will focus on the five most common alkaline earth metals: magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).</p>
      
      <h3>10.3.2 Molecular Formula and Uses of Alkaline Earth Metal Compounds</h3>
      <p>Alkaline earth metals form various compounds with important industrial and practical applications. Here are the molecular formulas and uses of some common alkaline earth metal compounds:</p>
      
      <h4>Quick Lime (Calcium Oxide, CaO)</h4>
      <p>Quick lime is produced by heating calcium carbonate (limestone) to a high temperature. Its molecular formula is \( \text{CaO} \). Quick lime is used in various applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used in the production of cement, mortar, and concrete.</li>
        <li>It is used in the steel industry for removing impurities.</li>
        <li>It is used in water treatment to remove acidity.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Bleaching Powder (Calcium Hypochlorite, Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>)</h4>
      <p>Bleaching powder is a yellowish-white powder with the molecular formula \( \text{Ca(ClO)}_2 \). It is used as a powerful oxidizing and bleaching agent:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used in the textile industry for bleaching fabrics.</li>
        <li>It is used in water treatment for disinfection and purification purposes.</li>
        <li>It is used in the paper industry for bleaching pulp.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Magnesia (Magnesium Oxide, MgO)</h4>
      <p>Magnesia is an alkaline earth metal compound with the molecular formula \( \text{MgO} \). It has several uses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used as a refractory material in high-temperature applications.</li>
        <li>It is used in the production of electrical insulators.</li>
        <li>It is used as an ingredient in antacids for treating heartburn and indigestion.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Plaster of Paris (Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate, \( \text{CaSO}_4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\text{H}_2\text{O} \))</h4>
      <p>Plaster of Paris is a white powder with the molecular formula \( \text{CaSO}_4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\text{H}_2\text{O} \). It is widely used in the construction and medical industries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used for making casts and molds in orthopedics.</li>
        <li>It is used for creating decorative elements, such as sculptures and molds.</li>
        <li>It is used in dentistry for making dental impressions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Epsom Salt (Magn
      
      esium Sulfate Heptahydrate, \( \text{MgSO}_4 \cdot 7\text{H}_2\text{O} \))</h4>
      <p>Epsom salt is a crystalline compound with the molecular formula \( \text{MgSO}_4 \cdot 7\text{H}_2\text{O} \). It is commonly used for various purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is used as a bath salt for relaxation and muscle soreness relief.</li>
        <li>It is used in gardening as a fertilizer to provide magnesium and sulfur to plants.</li>
        <li>It is used in certain medical treatments, such as Epsom salt baths for certain skin conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>10.3.3 Solubility of Hydroxides, Carbonates, and Sulphates of Alkaline Earth Metals</h3>
      <p>The solubility of hydroxides, carbonates, and sulphates of alkaline earth metals follows a general trend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hydroxides: The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides increases as you move down the group. Beryllium hydroxide (Be(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is amphoteric and does not show typical alkaline behavior.</li>
        <li>Carbonates: The solubility of alkaline earth metal carbonates decreases as you move down the group. Beryllium carbonate (BeCO<sub>3</sub>) is soluble in water, but the carbonates of magnesium (MgCO<sub>3</sub>), calcium (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), strontium (SrCO<sub>3</sub>), barium (BaCO<sub>3</sub>), and radium (RaCO<sub>3</sub>) are insoluble or sparingly soluble.</li>
        <li>Sulphates: The solubility of alkaline earth metal sulphates decreases as you move down the group. Beryllium sulphate (BeSO<sub>4</sub>) is highly soluble, but the sulphates of magnesium (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), calcium (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), strontium (SrSO<sub>4</sub>), barium (BaSO<sub>4</sub>), and radium (RaSO<sub>4</sub>) become increasingly less soluble.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>10.3.4 Stability of Carbonate and Nitrate of Alkaline Earth Metals</h3>
      <p>The stability of carbonate and nitrate compounds of alkaline earth metals follows a general trend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carbonates: The stability of alkaline earth metal carbonates increases as you move down the group. Beryllium carbonate (BeCO<sub>3</sub>) is unstable and easily decomposes, while the carbonates of magnesium (MgCO<sub>3</sub>), calcium (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), strontium (SrCO<sub>3</sub>), barium (BaCO<sub>3</sub>), and radium (RaCO<sub>3</sub>) are stable.</li>
        <li>Nitrates: The nitrates of all alkaline earth metals are stable and do not decompose easily.</li>
      </ul>
