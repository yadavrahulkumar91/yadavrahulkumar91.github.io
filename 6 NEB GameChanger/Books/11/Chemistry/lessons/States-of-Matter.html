      <h2>7.1.1 Kinetic Theory of Gas and its Postulates</h2>
      <p>
          The kinetic theory of gases describes the behavior of gases based on the motion of their particles. It is based on the following postulates:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Gases are composed of small particles called molecules or atoms.</li>
          <li>The molecules of a gas are in constant random motion.</li>
          <li>The volume occupied by the gas molecules is negligible compared to the total volume of the gas.</li>
          <li>The collisions between gas molecules are perfectly elastic.</li>
          <li>The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>7.1.2 Gas Laws</h2>
      
      <h3>7.1.2.1 Boyle's Law and Charles' Law</h3>
      <p>
          Boyle's law states that at constant temperature, the volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\]
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Charles' law states that at constant pressure, the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}\]
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.1.2.2 Avogadro's Law</h3>
      <p>
          Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of molecules. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[\frac{V_1}{n_1} = \frac{V_2}{n_2}\]
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.1.2.3 Combined Gas Equation</h3>
      <p>
          The combined gas equation combines Boyle's law, Charles' law, and Avogadro's law into a single equation. It can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1n_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2n_2}\]
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.1.2.4 Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure</h3>
      <p>
          Dalton's law of partial pressure states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \ldots\]
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.1.2.5 Graham's Law of Diffusion</h3>
      <p>
          Graham's law of diffusion states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[\text{Rate}_1 : \text{Rate}_2 = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}\]
      </p>
     
      <h2>7.1.3 Ideal Gas and Ideal Gas Equation</h2>
      <p>
          An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas that follows the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases. The ideal gas equation, also known as the equation of state for an ideal gas, combines the concepts of pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas. It can be represented as:
      </p>
      <p>
          \[PV = nRT\]
      </p>
      <p>
          Where:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>P is the pressure of the gas</li>
          <li>V is the volume of the gas</li>
          <li>n is the amount of gas (measured in moles)</li>
          <li>R is the universal gas constant (\(8.314 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \cdot \text{K}^{-1}\))</li>
          <li>T is the temperature of the gas (measured in Kelvin)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>7.1.4 Universal Gas Constant and its Significance</h2>
      <p>
          The universal gas constant (R) is a proportionality constant that relates the properties of gases in the ideal gas equation. It has a value of \(8.314 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \cdot \text{K}^{-1}\). The universal gas constant allows us to relate the macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure, volume, and temperature, to the microscopic properties of gas molecules, such as their mass and velocity. It is a fundamental constant in the field of thermodynamics and is used in various gas law calculations and equations.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.1.5 Deviation of Real Gas from Ideality (Solving Related Numerical Problems Based on Gas Laws)</h2>
      <p>
          Real gases do not always behave exactly according to the ideal gas equation. Under certain conditions, real gases may deviate from ideality due to factors such as intermolecular forces, molecular size, and high pressures. The deviation of real gases from ideality can be analyzed and quantified using various equations of state, such as the van der Waals equation and the Redlich-Kwong equation.
      </p>
      <p>
          To solve numerical problems related to gas laws, you can apply the principles and equations discussed earlier, such as Boyle's law, Charles' law, Avogadro's law, and the combined gas equation. These laws and equations allow you to calculate various properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, temperature, and amount, based on the given information and conditions.

      <h1>7.2 Liquid State</h1>
    
      <h2>7.2.1 Physical Properties of Liquids</h2>
      
      <h3>7.2.1.1 Evaporation and Condensation</h3>
      <p>
          Evaporation is the process by which a liquid changes into its vapor or gas phase at a temperature below its boiling point. It occurs when the molecules at the liquid surface gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces of the liquid and escape into the gas phase. Condensation, on the other hand, is the process by which a vapor or gas changes into its liquid phase. It occurs when the vapor molecules lose enough kinetic energy and come together to form a liquid due to the attractive forces between them.
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.2.1.2 Vapour Pressure and Boiling Point</h3>
      <p>
          Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor or gas in equilibrium with its liquid phase at a given temperature. It is a measure of the tendency of the liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure becomes equal to the external pressure. At this point, bubbles of vapor form throughout the liquid, and the liquid undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas.
      </p>
      
      <h3>7.2.1.3 Surface Tension and Viscosity (Qualitative Idea Only)</h3>
      <p>
          Surface tension is the property of a liquid that allows it to minimize its surface area. It is the force per unit length acting perpendicular to any line drawn on the liquid surface. Surface tension arises due to the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. Viscosity, on the other hand, is the measure of a liquid's resistance to flow. It is a result of the internal friction between the layers of a liquid as they slide past each other. Liquids with high viscosity flow slowly, while liquids with low viscosity flow easily.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.2.2 Liquid Crystals and Their Applications</h2>
      <p>
          Liquid crystals are a state of matter that exhibits properties of both liquids and solids. They have an ordered molecular arrangement like solids but also flow like liquids. Liquid crystals are widely used in display technologies, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in televisions, computer screens, and mobile devices. They are also used in other applications, including optical devices, temperature sensors, and drug delivery systems.
      </p>
      
      
      <h1>7.3 Solid State</h1>
    
      <h2>7.3.1 Types of Solids</h2>
      <p>
          Solids can be classified into different types based on the nature of the bonding and arrangement of their constituent particles. The main types of solids are:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Ionic Solids: Solids composed of positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic forces.</li>
          <li>Covalent Solids: Solids in which the constituent particles are covalently bonded to form a three-dimensional network.</li>
          <li>Molecular Solids: Solids composed of discrete molecules held together by intermolecular forces.</li>
          <li>Metallic Solids: Solids in which the constituent particles are positively charged metal ions held together by a sea of delocalized electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>7.3.2 Amorphous and Crystalline Solids</h2>
      <p>
          Amorphous solids lack long-range order in their atomic arrangement and have a disordered structure. Examples of amorphous solids include glass, rubber, and plastics. Crystalline solids, on the other hand, have a regular and repeating arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a three-dimensional lattice structure. Crystals exhibit characteristic geometric shapes and have well-defined faces, edges, and angles.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.3.3 Efflorescent, Deliquescent, and Hygroscopic Solids</h2>
      <p>
          Efflorescent solids are substances that lose water of crystallization when exposed to air, resulting in the formation of a powdery residue. Deliquescent solids are substances that absorb moisture from the air and dissolve in the absorbed water to form a solution. Hygroscopic solids have a strong affinity for water and readily absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.3.4 Crystallization and Crystal Growth</h2>
      <p>
          Crystallization is the process by which a solid forms from a solution, melt, or vapor and adopts a highly ordered and symmetrical arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules. Crystal growth occurs when additional particles join the existing crystal lattice, resulting in the enlargement of the crystal structure. The growth of crystals can be influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of impurities.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.3.5 Water of Crystallization</h2>
      <p>
          Water of crystallization refers to the water molecules that are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a compound during its formation. These water molecules are chemically bonded to the constituent particles of the crystal. The presence of water of crystallization can affect the physical properties of the compound, such as its color, stability, and solubility.
      </p>
      
      <h2>7.3.6 Introduction to Unit Crystal Lattice and Unit Cell</h2>
      <p>
          A unit crystal lattice is a three-dimensional arrangement of points in space that represents the regular repeating pattern of the crystal structure. It is used to describe the overall symmetry and arrangement of the constituent particles in a crystal. A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice that possesses all the symmetry elements and characteristics of the crystal. The unit cell provides a framework for understanding the crystal structure and its properties.
