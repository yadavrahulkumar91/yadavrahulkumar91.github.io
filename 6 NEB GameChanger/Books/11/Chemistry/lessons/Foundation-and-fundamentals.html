      <h1>1.1 General Introduction of Chemistry</h1>
  
  <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the study of matter, its properties, composition, and the changes it undergoes. It is often referred to as the central science because it connects and overlaps with various other scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, geology, and environmental science.</p>
  
  <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. It helps us explain the behavior of substances, their interactions, and the processes occurring at the atomic and molecular levels. The knowledge of chemistry allows us to comprehend the composition of matter and how different substances can be combined or transformed to create new materials.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to its theoretical importance, chemistry has significant practical applications in various fields. It is essential in industries such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, energy production, environmental protection, and food technology. Chemistry also plays a vital role in fields like medicine, agriculture, and forensic science.</p>
  
  <p>Chemistry is divided into several branches, each focusing on specific aspects of the subject. These branches include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Organic Chemistry: Study of carbon-containing compounds.</li>
    <li>Inorganic Chemistry: Study of non-carbon-containing compounds.</li>
    <li>Physical Chemistry: Study of the physical properties and behavior of matter.</li>
    <li>Analytical Chemistry: Study of analyzing and determining the composition of substances.</li>
    <li>Biochemistry: Study of chemical processes and substances in living organisms.</li>
    <li>Environmental Chemistry: Study of chemical interactions in the environment.</li>
    <li>Industrial Chemistry: Application of chemistry in industrial processes and manufacturing.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Overall, chemistry is a fundamental science that provides a framework for understanding the nature of matter and its transformations. It has far-reaching implications in our daily lives, technological advancements, and the betterment of society as a whole.</p>

  <h1>1.3 Basic Concepts of Chemistry</h1>
  
  <h2>Atoms</h2>
  
  <p>An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the chemical properties of an element. It consists of a nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, and negatively charged electrons that orbit the nucleus. Atoms are represented using chemical symbols, such as H for hydrogen and O for oxygen.</p>
  
  <h2>Molecules</h2>
  
  <p>A molecule is a group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules can be composed of atoms of the same element (e.g., O<sub>2</sub> - oxygen gas) or different elements (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O - water). Molecules are the building blocks of compounds.</p>
  
  <h2>Relative Masses of Atoms and Molecules</h2>
  
  <p>The relative masses of atoms and molecules are compared to a standard unit called the atomic mass unit (amu). The atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The atomic mass of an atom is the average mass of its isotopes, taking into account their relative abundances.</p>
  
  <h2>Radicals</h2>
  
  <p>A radical is a group of atoms that behaves as a single unit, often carrying a charge. It can be an atom or a group of atoms that are joined together and exhibit a characteristic behavior in chemical reactions. For example, the hydroxyl radical (OHâ€¢) consists of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom and is highly reactive.</p>
  
  <h2>Molecular Formula</h2>
  
  <p>The molecular formula represents the exact number and types of atoms present in a molecule. It provides information about the elemental composition of the molecule. For example, the molecular formula of glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, indicating that it consists of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.</p>
  
  <h2>Empirical Formula</h2>
  
  <p>The empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound. It does not provide the actual number of atoms but gives the relative proportions. For example, the empirical formula of glucose is CH<sub>2</sub>O, indicating a ratio of one carbon atom to two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.</p>
 

  <h1>1.4 Percentage Composition from Molecular Formula</h1>
  
  <p>The percentage composition of a compound refers to the relative mass or proportion of each element present in the compound. It can be determined from the molecular formula of the compound.</p>
  
  <p>To calculate the percentage composition of an element in a compound, follow these steps:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Obtain the molecular formula of the compound.</li>
    <li>Determine the molar mass of the compound by adding up the atomic masses of all the atoms in the formula.</li>
    <li>Identify the number of atoms of the element in the formula.</li>
    <li>Calculate the molar mass of the element by multiplying the atomic mass of the element by the number of atoms.</li>
    <li>Divide the molar mass of the element by the molar mass of the compound and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Here's the formula for calculating the percentage composition:</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Percentage Composition = (Molar Mass of Element / Molar Mass of Compound) x 100%</strong></p>
  
  <p>For example, let's calculate the percentage composition of oxygen in water (H<sub>2</sub>O):</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Molar mass of oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol (atomic mass of oxygen)</li>
    <li>Molar mass of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) = 18.02 g/mol (2 x atomic mass of hydrogen + atomic mass of oxygen)</li>
    <li>Percentage composition of oxygen in water = (16.00 g/mol / 18.02 g/mol) x 100% = 88.87%</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Similarly, you can calculate the percentage composition of other elements in a compound using the given molecular formula and atomic masses of the elements.</p>
