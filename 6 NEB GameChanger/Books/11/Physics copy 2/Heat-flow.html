<h1>Conduction: Thermal Conductivity and Measurement</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Conduction is a mode of heat transfer that occurs within a solid or between solids in direct contact. It involves the transfer of thermal energy from higher-temperature regions to lower-temperature regions through molecular collisions.</p>

<h2>Thermal Conductivity</h2>

<p>Thermal conductivity is a property that quantifies the ability of a material to conduct heat. It is represented by the symbol $\kappa$ (kappa) and is defined as the amount of heat transferred per unit time through a unit area of a material when there is a unit temperature gradient.</p>

<p>The rate of heat transfer ($\dot{Q}$) through conduction can be expressed using Fourier's law of heat conduction:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\dot{Q} = -\kappa \cdot A \cdot \frac{dT}{dx}$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer</li>
   <li>$\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity</li>
   <li>$A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material</li>
   <li>$\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient along the direction of heat flow</li>
</ul>

<p>Thermal conductivity depends on the physical properties of the material, including its molecular structure, density, and specific heat capacity. Different materials have different thermal conductivities, with metals generally having higher conductivity compared to non-metals.</p>

<h2>Measurement of Thermal Conductivity</h2>

<p>There are several methods for measuring the thermal conductivity of materials:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Parallel Plate Method: In this method, a sample material is placed between two parallel plates, and a temperature difference is created. The heat flow across the sample is measured, and the thermal conductivity is calculated using the dimensions of the sample and the temperature gradient.</li>
   <li>Hot Wire Method: The hot wire method involves passing an electric current through a wire placed in contact with the material. The wire heats up, and the temperature rise is measured. The thermal conductivity is determined based on the power supplied to the wire, its dimensions, and the temperature difference.</li>
   <li>Guarded Hot Plate Method: This method uses a guarded hot plate apparatus where the sample is sandwiched between two plates. One plate is heated, and the other plate is cooled. The thermal conductivity is determined by measuring the heat flow through the sample and considering the dimensions and temperatures involved.</li>
   <li>Transient Methods: Transient methods involve measuring the temperature response of a material to a sudden change in heat input. These methods include the transient plane source (TPS) technique and the laser flash method.</li>
</ol>

<p>The choice of measurement method depends on factors such as the type of material, sample size and shape, temperature range, and required accuracy.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>The knowledge of thermal conductivity and its measurement finds applications in various fields, including:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Heat Transfer Analysis: Understanding thermal conductivity helps in analyzing heat transfer processes and designing efficient heat transfer systems.</li>
   <li>Material Selection: Thermal conductivity data is important for selecting materials in applications where heat transfer control is critical, such as building insulation, electronic devices, and heat exchangers.</li>
   <li>Engineering Design: The thermal conductivity values of materials are used in engineering calculations and simulations for designing and optimizing thermal systems and components.</li>
   <li>Materials Research: Researchers use thermal conductivity measurements to study the properties and behavior of materials under different thermal conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Convection</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Convection is a mode of heat transfer that occurs in fluids (liquids and gases) due to the combined effect of heat conduction and fluid motion. It involves the transfer of thermal energy through the movement of fluid particles.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Convection</h2>

<p>Convection can be classified into two types: natural convection and forced convection.</p>

<h3>Natural Convection</h3>

<p>Natural convection occurs when fluid motion is induced solely by temperature differences within the fluid. The fluid near a heat source becomes warmer, expands, and becomes less dense, causing it to rise. As it rises, cooler fluid from the surroundings replaces it, creating a continuous circulation pattern.</p>

<p>The rate of heat transfer by natural convection can be described by Newton's law of cooling:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\dot{Q} = h \cdot A \cdot \Delta T$</p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>$\dot{Q}$ is the rate of heat transfer</li>
   <li>$h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient</li>
   <li>$A$ is the surface area</li>
   <li>$\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between the surface and the surrounding fluid</li>
</ul>

<p>The convective heat transfer coefficient depends on various factors such as fluid properties, flow conditions, and surface geometry.</p>

<h3>Forced Convection</h3>

<p>Forced convection occurs when fluid motion is induced by external means such as fans, pumps, or any other mechanical devices. The fluid is forced to move over a surface or through a channel, enhancing the convective heat transfer.</p>

<p>The rate of heat transfer by forced convection can be described by the following equation:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$\dot{Q} = h \cdot A \cdot \Delta T$</p>

<p>where the convective heat transfer coefficient ($h$) takes into account the forced convection effects.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>Convection has various practical applications in different fields:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Heat Exchangers: Convection plays a vital role in the design and operation of heat exchangers used in industries, HVAC systems, and refrigeration systems.</li>
   <li>Fluid Flow: Understanding convection helps in analyzing fluid flow patterns, predicting heat transfer rates, and optimizing the design of pipes, ducts, and channels.</li>
   <li>Natural Phenomena: Convection is responsible for natural phenomena such as atmospheric circulation, ocean currents, and weather patterns.</li>
   <li>Cooking and Baking: Convection ovens and cooking techniques rely on the movement of hot air to cook food more evenly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Black-body Spectrum</h2>

<p>A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all wavelengths of radiation that fall on it. When heated, a black body emits radiation over a wide range of wavelengths. The distribution of this radiation is known as the black-body spectrum.</p>

<p>The black-body spectrum has some distinctive characteristics:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Continuous Spectrum: The spectrum is continuous, meaning it contains radiation at all wavelengths.</li>
   <li>Peak Wavelength: The wavelength at which the intensity of radiation is maximum is determined by the temperature of the black body. It follows Wien's displacement law: $\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}$, where $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the peak wavelength, $b$ is Wien's displacement constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.</li>
   <li>Intensity Distribution: The intensity of radiation decreases as the wavelength deviates from the peak wavelength. The shape of the intensity distribution is described by Planck's radiation law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planck's Radiation Law</h2>

<p>Planck's radiation law describes the intensity distribution of black-body radiation as a function of wavelength and temperature. It is given by the formula:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$B(\lambda, T) = \frac{{2hc^2}}{{\lambda^5}} \cdot \frac{1}{{e^{\frac{{hc}}{{\lambda kT}}} - 1}}$</p>
