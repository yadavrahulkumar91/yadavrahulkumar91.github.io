      <h2>Electric Currents: Drift Velocity and its Relation with Current</h2>

      <p>Electric current refers to the flow of electric charge through a conductor. In a metallic conductor, the flow of current is due to the motion of free electrons. The drift velocity of electrons plays a significant role in understanding the relation between drift velocity and electric current.</p>
      
      <h3>Drift Velocity</h3>
      
      <p>The drift velocity is the average velocity at which free electrons move in a conductor under the influence of an electric field. It is important to note that individual electrons move randomly with high velocities, but their net movement constitutes a drift velocity in a particular direction.</p>
      
      <p>The drift velocity of electrons can be influenced by factors such as the electric field strength, the nature of the conductor material, and the presence of impurities or lattice defects. In general, higher electric field strength and lower resistance result in a higher drift velocity of electrons.</p>
      
      <h3>Relation with Current</h3>
      
      <p>The drift velocity of electrons is directly related to the electric current flowing through a conductor. The relationship between drift velocity and current can be understood using the concept of charge carriers and charge flow.</p>
      
      <p>The electric current (I) flowing through a conductor is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge (Q) passing through a given cross-sectional area (A) in a unit of time (t). Mathematically, it is expressed as:</p>
      
      <p align="center">
        $ I = \frac{Q}{t} $
      </p>
      
      <p>Since current is the rate of charge flow, it can also be expressed as the product of the charge (Q) and the drift velocity (v) of the charge carriers:</p>
      
      <p align="center">
        $ I = nqvA $
      </p>
      
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>n is the number density of charge carriers (such as electrons) in the conductor.</li>
        <li>q is the charge on each carrier (in coulombs).</li>
        <li>v is the drift velocity of the charge carriers (in meters per second).</li>
        <li>A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor (in square meters).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This equation shows that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the drift velocity of the charge carriers. A higher drift velocity results in a higher current, given a constant number density of charge carriers and cross-sectional area of the conductor.</p>
      
      <h3>Applications</h3>
      
      <p>The understanding of drift velocity and its relation to current is essential in various practical applications, including:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical circuit design: Knowledge of current and drift velocity helps in designing circuits, selecting appropriate conductor materials, and determining their dimensions.</li>
        <li>Electrical transmission: Understanding the relationship between current and drift velocity is crucial for efficient transmission of electrical power over long distances.</li>
        <li>Semiconductor devices: In devices such as transistors and diodes, the drift velocity and current play a vital role in their operation and performance.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <p>The drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is directly related to the electric current flowing through it. Understanding the relationship between drift velocity and current is fundamental in analyzing and designing electrical circuits and devices.</p>
      
      <h2>Ohm's Law, Electrical Resistance, Resistivity, Conductivity</h2>

      <p>Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits that describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. It states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.</p>
      
      <h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
      
      <p>Ohm's Law can be mathematically expressed as:</p>
      
      <p align="center">
        $ I = \frac{V}{R} $
      </p>
      
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I is the electric current (in amperes).</li>
        <li>V is the voltage or potential difference (in volts).</li>
        <li>R is the electrical resistance (in ohms).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This equation implies that if the voltage applied across a conductor is increased, the current flowing through it will also increase, provided the resistance remains constant. Similarly, if the resistance of the conductor is increased, the current will decrease for a given voltage.</p>
      
      <h3>Electrical Resistance</h3>
      
      <p>Electrical resistance is a property of a material that impedes the flow of electric current. It is caused by factors such as the type of material, its dimensions, temperature, and the presence of impurities. Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).</p>
      
      <p>The resistance (R) of a conductor can be determined using the equation:</p>
      
      <p align="center">
        $ R = \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A} $
      </p>
      
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>R is the resistance (in ohms).</li>
        <li>ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material (in ohm-meters).</li>
        <li>L is the length of the conductor (in meters).</li>
        <li>A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor (in square meters).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Resistivity and Conductivity</h3>
      
      <p>Resistivity (ρ) is a material property that determines its ability to resist the flow of electric current. It is specific to each material and depends on factors such as temperature and impurities. Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity (σ), which represents a material's ability to conduct electric current.</p>
      
      <p>The relationship between resistivity, conductivity, and resistance is given by:</p>
      
      <p align="center">
        $ R = \frac{1}{\sigma} \cdot \frac{L}{A} = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} $
      </p>
      
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>R is the resistance (in ohms).</li>
        <li>σ (sigma) is the conductivity of the material (in siemens per meter).</li>
        <li>L is the length of the conductor (in meters).</li>
        <li>A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor (in square meters).</li>
        <li>ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material (in ohm-meters).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Applications</h3>
      
      <p>Understanding Ohm's Law, electrical resistance, resistivity, and conductivity is essential in various practical applications, including:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical circuit analysis: Ohm's Law allows the calculation of current, voltage, and resistance in electrical circuits.</li>

      <h2>Current-Voltage Relations; Ohmic and Non-Ohmic Resistance</h2>

<p>The relationship between current and voltage in a circuit is determined by the characteristics of the components present. While some components exhibit a linear relationship between current and voltage, others may have nonlinear behavior. This distinction leads to the concepts of ohmic and non-ohmic resistance.</p>

<h3>Ohm's Law Revisited</h3>

<p>According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it, provided the resistance remains constant. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:</p>

<p align="center">
  $ I = \frac{V}{R} $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I is the electric current (in amperes).</li>
  <li>V is the voltage or potential difference (in volts).</li>

In other words, the resistance of an ohmic component remains constant over a wide range of applied voltages. Most metallic conductors, such as wires, have ohmic resistance under normal operating conditions.</p>

<p>The resistance of an ohmic component can be determined using the formula:</p>

<p align="center">

The resistance of a non-ohmic component varies with the applied voltage or current. Examples of non-ohmic components include diodes, transistors, and certain types of semiconductor devices.</p>

<p>For non-ohmic components, the relationship between current and voltage is typically described using nonlinear equations or characteristic curves specific to the component. The resistance may vary with temperature, current direction, or other factors.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Current-voltage relations, ohmic and non-ohmic resistance, provide insights into the behavior of electrical components and materials.

<h2>Resistances in Series and Parallel</h2>

<p>When resistors are connected in an electrical circuit, their arrangement affects the total resistance and the flow of current. The two common arrangements are resistances in series and resistances in parallel.</p>

<h3>Resistances in Series</h3>

<p>Resistances are said to be connected in series when they are arranged sequentially, with the current passing through each resistor in succession. In a series circuit, the total resistance (RT) is the sum of the individual resistances.</p>

<p>The formula to calculate the total resistance of resistances in series is:</p>

<p align="center">
  $ R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$R_T$ is the total resistance of the series circuit (in ohms).</li>
  <li>$R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n$ are the individual resistances (in ohms).</li>
</ul>

<p>In a series circuit, the current passing through each resistor is the same. However, the voltage across each resistor may differ, depending on the value of the resistance.</p>

<h3>Resistances in Parallel</h3>

<p>Resistances are said to be connected in parallel when they are arranged such that the ends of all the resistors are connected together at one point and the other ends are also connected together. In a parallel circuit, the reciprocal of the total resistance (RT) is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.</p>

<p>The formula to calculate the total resistance of resistances in parallel is:</p>

<p align="center">
  $ \frac{1}{R_T} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n} $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$R_T$ is the total resistance of the parallel circuit (in ohms).</li>
  <li>$R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots, R_n$ are the individual resistances (in ohms).</li>
</ul>

<p>In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each resistor is the same, while the current is divided among the resistors based on their respective resistances.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>The understanding of resistances in series and parallel is crucial in various practical applications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electrical circuit design: Knowledge of resistances in series and parallel helps in designing circuits with desired total resistance and current distribution.</li>
  <li>Power distribution: Understanding parallel resistances is essential in designing power supply systems and distributing power to multiple devices.</li>
  <li>Resistor networks: The arrangement of resistors in series and parallel is utilized in designing complex resistor networks for specific circuit requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Resistances in series and parallel exhibit different behaviors in electrical circuits. Series resistances add up to determine the total resistance, while parallel resistances result in a reciprocal relationship. The knowledge of these arrangements and their effects is fundamental in circuit design and analysis.</p>
<h2>Potential Divider</h2>

<p>A potential divider, also known as a voltage divider, is a circuit arrangement used to divide a voltage into smaller fractions. It consists of two or more resistors connected in series across a voltage source, with the output voltage taken from the connection between the resistors.</p>

<h3>Working Principle</h3>

<p>The potential divider works based on the principle of voltage division in a series circuit. According to this principle, the voltage across each resistor in a series circuit is directly proportional to its resistance.</p>

<p>Let's consider a potential divider with two resistors, R1 and R2, connected in series. The input voltage (Vin) is applied across the series combination, and the output voltage (Vout) is taken across resistor R2.</p>

<p>The output voltage (Vout) can be calculated using the voltage division formula:</p>

<p align="center">
  $ V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \times V_{in} $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$V_{out}$ is the output voltage across resistor R2 (in volts).</li>
  <li>$R_1$ is the resistance of resistor R1 (in ohms).</li>
  <li>$R_2$ is the resistance of resistor R2 (in ohms).</li>
  <li>$V_{in}$ is the input voltage applied across the series combination (in volts).</li>
</ul>

<p>The output voltage can be adjusted by changing the values of resistors R1 and R2. By selecting appropriate resistor values, different fractions of the input voltage can be obtained at the output.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>Potential dividers find wide applications in various electronic circuits and systems, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Voltage level shifting: Potential dividers are used to shift the voltage level of a signal to match the input requirements of other components or devices.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The potential divider is a versatile circuit arrangement used to divide a voltage into smaller fractions. By selecting appropriate resistor values, the output voltage can be adjusted as needed. The potential divider finds applications in voltage level shifting, volume control, reference voltage generation, and sensor interfacing, among others.</p>
<h2>Electromotive Force (EMF) of a Source and Internal Resistance</h2>

<p>In an electrical circuit, a voltage source provides the electromotive force (EMF) necessary to drive the flow of electric current. However, real voltage sources, such as batteries or generators, have an internal resistance that affects their performance.</p>

<h3>Electromotive Force (EMF)</h3>

<p>The electromotive force (EMF) of a source is the maximum potential difference it can provide when no current is drawn from it. It represents the energy conversion capability of the source and is typically measured in volts (V).</p>

<p>The EMF is responsible for establishing a potential difference across the circuit, which drives the flow of electric charge. It can be thought of as the "push" or "pressure" that moves the charges in the circuit.</p>

<h3>Internal Resistance</h3>

<p>All real voltage sources, including batteries and generators, have an internal resistance associated with them. This internal resistance arises from the inherent characteristics of the source and the flow of current through its components.</p>

<p>The internal resistance of a source is represented by the symbol r. It acts as an additional resistance within the source itself and causes a voltage drop when current flows through it.</p>

<p>The presence of internal resistance affects the terminal voltage (V) of the source. The terminal voltage (V) can be calculated using Ohm's law:</p>

<p align="center">
  $ V = \text{EMF} - Ir $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>V is the terminal voltage of the source (in volts).</li>
  <li>EMF is the electromotive force of the source (in volts).</li>
  <li>I is the current flowing through the circuit (in amperes).</li>
  <li>r is the internal resistance of the source (in ohms).</li>
</ul>

<p>The terminal voltage decreases as the current increases due to the voltage drop across the internal resistance. When no current is drawn from the source (open circuit condition), the terminal voltage equals the EMF.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>The understanding of EMF and internal resistance is essential in various practical applications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing and analyzing electrical circuits: Knowledge of EMF and internal resistance helps in accurately predicting the behavior of voltage sources and their impact on circuit performance.</li>
  <li>Battery selection and usage: Understanding internal resistance is crucial in selecting batteries for specific applications and considering their limitations in terms of current delivery and voltage stability.</li>
  <li>Power supply design: Internal resistance affects the voltage regulation and efficiency of power supply systems, and it needs to be considered in their design.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The electromotive force (EMF) of a source provides the maximum potential difference in an electrical circuit, driving the flow of current. However, real sources have an internal resistance that causes a voltage drop. The understanding of EMF and internal resistance is important for circuit design, battery selection, and power supply design.</p>

</ul>

<p>Work done is positive when the charge moves in the direction of the electric field (from higher potential to lower potential) and negative when the charge moves against the electric field.</p>

<h3>Power in Electrical Circuits</h3>

<p>Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. In electrical circuits, power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or delivered.</p>

<p>The power (P) can be calculated using the formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P is the power (in watts).</li>
  <li>W is the work done (in joules).</li>

</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I is the current flowing through the circuit (in amperes).</li>
