  <h2 class="qa-question">Velocity of sound in solids in more than that in liquids, why?<span class="right-text">[2074 Set B Q.No. 3a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in solids is more than that in liquids due to the higher elasticity of solids. Solids have a higher modulus of elasticity than liquids, which means that they can deform and return to their original shape more quickly. This allows sound waves to travel faster through solids than through liquids.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">The velocity of sound in solid is generally greater than that in gas at STP. Why? Give reason.<span class="right-text">[2073 Set C Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in solids is generally greater than that in gases at STP due to the higher density and modulus of elasticity of solids. The density of solids is much higher than that of gases, which means that the molecules in solids are closer together and can transmit sound waves more effectively. In addition, the modulus of elasticity of solids is also higher, allowing sound waves to travel more quickly through them.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">When sound waves travel through a medium, does the temperature at various points remain constant? Explain.<span class="right-text">[2072 Set C Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">When sound waves travel through a medium, the temperature at various points does not remain constant. As the sound waves propagate, they produce compressions and rarefactions in the medium, which cause changes in pressure and temperature. The compressions lead to an increase in pressure and temperature, while rarefactions lead to a decrease in pressure and temperature. These changes are small and usually not noticeable, but they do occur.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Why does sound travel faster in metals than in air?<span class="right-text">[2071 Set D Q.No. 3a/ 2066 Supp Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Sound travels faster in metals than in air because the speed of sound is directly proportional to the elasticity and density of the medium. Metals have higher densities and greater elasticities compared to air, allowing sound waves to travel faster through them.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">The speed of sound in humid air is more than that in dry air, why?<span class="right-text">[2070 Supp. Set B Q.No. 3a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in humid air is more than that in dry air because water vapor, which is present in humid air, has a lower molecular weight than nitrogen and oxygen, which are the main constituents of dry air. This lower molecular weight of water vapor makes the air less dense, allowing sound waves to travel through it faster.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Although the density of solid is high, the velocity of sound is greater in solid, explain.<span class="right-text">[2070 Set C Q.No. 3a/ 2063 Q.No. 2a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound is greater in solids than in liquids and gases because solids have higher elasticity and intermolecular forces. These properties enable sound waves to propagate more quickly through a solid medium as the molecules are more closely packed together, and the restoring forces are stronger, leading to a faster transmission of energy. Although the density of solids is high, the strong intermolecular forces and compact arrangement of molecules allow for faster sound propagation.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Is it possible that the velocity of sound is greater in solid than that in a gas at STP? Justify your answer. <span class="right-text">[2069 Supp Set B Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    Yes, it is possible for the velocity of sound to be greater in a solid than in a gas at STP. This is because the velocity of sound depends on the properties of the medium, such as its density, elasticity, and temperature. Solids are denser and more elastic than gases, and therefore sound travels faster through solids than through gases. At the same temperature and pressure, the average speed of sound in air at sea level is about 343 meters per second, while in some solids like steel it can be as high as 6100 meters per second.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Velocity of sound increases on a cloudy day. Why? <span class="right-text">[2066 Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    On a cloudy day, the temperature of the air near the surface of the earth is generally warmer than the temperature of the air higher up in the atmosphere. This is because the clouds trap the heat radiated from the earth's surface, leading to a decrease in temperature with altitude. As sound waves travel faster in warmer air, the velocity of sound increases on a cloudy day when the air near the surface of the earth is warmer. Therefore, sound waves travel faster through the lower layers of the atmosphere on a cloudy day, resulting in an increase in the velocity of sound.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Sound at a distance can be heard distinctly at night than in the day time. Why? <span class="right-text">[2065 Q.No. 1c/ 2060 Q.No. 2c/ 2052 Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    During the day, the temperature of the atmosphere is generally warmer near the surface of the earth and decreases with altitude. This creates a gradient in the refractive index of the air, which bends sound waves away from the surface of the earth and disperses them. This causes sound waves to become weaker as they travel and makes it difficult to hear sounds from a distance. 
At night, the temperature of the atmosphere near the surface of the earth cools faster than the temperature higher up in the atmosphere, which leads to an inversion in the refractive index gradient. This causes sound waves to bend towards the surface of the earth and focus them towards the listener. Therefore, sound waves can be heard distinctly at night than in the day time, especially over long distances.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Explain why the velocity of sound in solids is greater than that in gases, though the densities of solids are greater than that of gases. [2064 Q.No. 2d]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in a medium depends on the elasticity and density of the medium. Solids have a higher elasticity than gases, which means that they can transmit sound waves more efficiently. Although the densities of solids are greater than that of gases, the increased elasticity more than compensates for this, resulting in a higher velocity of sound in solids than in gases.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Do sound waves need a medium to travel from one point to other point in space? What properties of the medium are relevant? [2062 Q.No. 1c]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Yes, sound waves require a medium to travel through. This is because sound waves are mechanical waves that require the particles of the medium to vibrate in order to propagate. The properties of the medium that are relevant for sound wave propagation are its density, elasticity, and viscosity. In general, sound waves travel faster in denser and more elastic media, and slower in more viscous media.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Why are sounds heard better on a wet day than on a dry day? [2056 Q.No. 1c]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Sounds are heard better on a wet day than on a dry day because the moisture in the air increases the speed of sound. This is because the water molecules in humid air are closer together, which means that sound waves can propagate more quickly through the air. In addition, the water droplets in the air can absorb sound waves and prevent them from dissipating, which can make sounds appear louder and clearer.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Is velocity of sound more in damp air or in dry air? Explain.<span class="right-text">[2054 Q.No. 1b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound is generally greater in dry air than in damp air. This is because the density of damp air is higher than that of dry air, which makes it more difficult for sound waves to travel through damp air. Additionally, water molecules in damp air can absorb some of the energy of sound waves, which further reduces the speed of sound.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">The propagation of a sound wave can cause changes in the thermodynamic conditions of the medium, such as changes in pressure, temperature, and density. This is because the wave compresses and rarefies the medium as it travels through it, which can result in changes in the thermodynamic properties of the medium.

  where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of air and T is the temperature of the air in kelvins. The coefficient of thermal expansion of air is relatively small, so the correction is usually small as well. However, the correction becomes more significant at high temperatures and pressures. For example, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the correction is only about 0.6%. However, at a temperature of 100°C and a pressure of 10 atm, the correction is about 10%. 
  <br><br>
  Temperature and pressure have a significant effect on the velocity of sound in air. The velocity of sound in air increases with an increase in temperature and pressure. This is because an increase in temperature and pressure increases the density and stiffness of air, which makes it easier for sound waves to propagate through the medium. The velocity of sound in air is approximately 331 m/s at 0°C and 1 atm.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in a gas can be derived by considering the propagation of small pressure waves through the gas. The speed of sound is equal to the square root of the ratio of the elastic modulus of the gas to its density. For a gas with a constant specific heat, the speed of sound can be expressed as:

where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, P is the pressure, and ρ is the density.

Laplace's correction was needed because the above formula assumes that the gas is incompressible, which is not true in reality. As the pressure of the gas increases, its density also increases, which affects the velocity of sound.

In general, the velocity of sound increases with increasing temperature and pressure, and with decreasing density. The velocity of sound is also higher in solids and liquids than in gases. </p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in gases assumes that the particles of gas have zero size and that there are no forces of attraction or repulsion between them.

  <p class="qa-answer"> Newton's formula for the velocity of sound assumes that the medium is incompressible and that there are no changes in pressure or temperature within the medium. However, this is not the case for most real-world situations. Laplace's correction to Newton's formula takes into account the compressibility of the medium and the changes in pressure and temperature that occur within it. 
The velocity of sound is affected by various factors such as:

The temperature of the medium: The velocity of sound increases with an increase in temperature.
The density of the medium: The velocity of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the density of the medium.
The elasticity of the medium: The velocity of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus of the medium.
The pressure of the medium: The velocity of sound increases with an increase in pressure.
Therefore, the significance of Laplace's correction lies in its ability to provide a more accurate calculation of the velocity of sound in real-world situations, where the medium is not incompressible and where there are changes in pressure and temperature within the medium. </p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write an expression for the speed of sound in an ideal gas. Discuss the effect of a change in temperature on the speed of sound. <span class="right-text">[2068 Old Q.No. 5a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in an ideal gas can be expressed as:
v = sqrt(γ * R * T)

where v is the speed of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats (cp/cv) of the gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the gas.

The effect of a change in temperature on the speed of sound can be explained by the equation above. As the temperature of the gas increases, the speed of sound also increases. This is because an increase in temperature leads to an increase in the average speed of the gas particles, which in turn leads to an increase in the frequency of collisions between them. This increased frequency of collisions results in a higher propagation speed of sound waves through the gas. Conversely, a decrease in temperature leads to a decrease in the speed of sound in the gas.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in an elastic medium depends on the pressure, temperature, and density of the medium. An increase in pressure causes an increase in the density of the medium, which in turn increases the velocity of sound. An increase in temperature causes an increase in the velocity of sound due to an increase in the kinetic energy of the molecules, which leads to an increase in the frequency of the sound waves. The density of the medium decreases with an increase in temperature, which has a compensating effect on the velocity of sound. Therefore, the velocity of sound increases with an increase in temperature until it reaches a maximum value, after which it starts decreasing. The velocity of sound also increases with an increase in the density of the medium. </p>

  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in air at a particular temperature can be given by the formula:
v = √(γRT)

where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the adiabatic index, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

Let the initial velocity of sound at 27°C be v1.

Then, the final velocity of sound after a 60% increase is given by:

v2 = 1.6v1

We know that the velocity of sound in air is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature. Therefore, we can write:

v1/v2 = √(T1/T2)

where T1 is the absolute temperature at 27°C, and T2 is the absolute temperature at which the velocity of sound increases by 60%.

Substituting the given values, we get:

v1/(1.6v1) = √(300/T2)

1/1.6 = √(300/T2)

Squaring both sides, we get:

1/2.56 = 300/T2

T2 = 300/0.390625

T2 ≈ 768.2 K

Therefore, the temperature at which the velocity of sound in air is increased by 60% to what at 27°C is approximately 768.2 K.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer"> 
    The time interval between the lightning and the thunder is 3 seconds. This time represents the difference between the arrival times of light and sound at the observer's location. Since light travels much faster than sound, we can assume that the time taken by light to travel from the lightning to the observer is negligible. Therefore, the time interval is a measure of the time taken by sound to travel from the lightning to the observer.

The velocity of sound in air is given as 340 m/s. Thus, the distance travelled by sound during the 3-second time interval is:

Distance = Velocity x Time
= 340 m/s x 3 s
= 1020 meters

Therefore, the lightning has struck approximately 1020 meters (or 1.02 km) away from the observer.

    The velocity of sound in air changes with temperature. The relationship between the velocity of sound, frequency, and wavelength is given by the formula:
csharp

Velocity = Frequency x Wavelength

At 20°C, the velocity of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s. Thus, the wavelength of the sound from the source is:

Wavelength = Velocity / Frequency
           = 343 m/s / 550 Hz
           = 0.6236 meters or 62.36 cm

At 0°C, the velocity of sound in air is approximately 331 m/s. Thus, the wavelength of the sound from the source is:

Wavelength = Velocity / Frequency
           = 331 m/s / 550 Hz
           = 0.6018 meters or 60.18 cm

  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in air increases with increasing temperature. The difference in speed of longitudinal waves in air at 27°C and at -13°C can be calculated using the formula:
Δv = v₂ - v₁ = 331.5(m/s) * [(T₂ + 273K)/(273K)]^0.5 - 331.5(m/s) * [(T₁ + 273K)/(273K)]^0.5

where T₁ = -13°C = 260K and T₂ = 27°C = 300K

Δv = v₂ - v₁ = 331.5(m/s) * [(300K)/(273K)]^0.5 - 331.5(m/s) * [(260K)/(273K)]^0.5
Δv = 16.2 m/s

The speed of longitudinal waves in air at 0°C can be calculated using the same formula:

v = 331.5(m/s) * [(T + 273K)/(273K)]^0.5
where T = 0°C = 273K

v = 331.5(m/s) * [(273K)/(273K)]^0.5
v = 331.5(m/s)

Therefore, the speed of longitudinal waves in air at 0°C is 331.5 m/s.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in air can be calculated using the formula:
v = 331.5(m/s) * [(T + 273K)/(273K)]^0.5

where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

To find the temperature at which the velocity of sound in air is increased by 50% to that at 27°C, we can set up the following equation:

1.5v = 331.5(m/s) * [(T + 273K)/(273K)]^0.5

Dividing both sides by 331.5 m/s and squaring gives:

[(1.5v/331.5)^2] * 273K = T + 273K

Simplifying:

T = [(1.5v/331.5)^2 - 1] * 273°C

Substituting v = speed of sound at 27°C = 331.5 m/s * [(27+273)/273]^0.5 = 331.5 m/s * 1.004 = 333.3 m/s

T = [(1.5*333.3/331.5)^2 - 1] * 273°C
T ≈ 129°C

Therefore, the temperature at which the velocity of sound in air is increased by 50% to that at 27°C is approximately 129°C.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Given, first resonance position = 18 cm, second resonance position = 56 cm, frequency of tuning fork = 480 Hz.<br> 
  Let the speed of sound in air be v and the end correction of the tube be e.<br>
  The wavelength of the sound wave in the tube can be calculated as:<br>
  λ = 2L/n where L is the length of the air column and n is the harmonic number.<br>
  For the first resonance position, n = 1, λ = 2 x 18 cm = 36 cm = 0.36 m.<br>
  For the second resonance position, n = 2, λ = 2 x 56 cm = 112 cm = 1.12 m.<br>
  The speed of sound in air can be calculated using the formula:<br>
  v = fλ where f is the frequency of the tuning fork.<br>
  Therefore, v = 480 Hz x 0.36 m = 172.8 m/s and v = 480 Hz x 1.12 m = 537.6 m/s for the first and second resonance positions respectively.<br>
  From these equations, we can solve for the end correction of the tube as follows:<br>
  v = (l + e) f where l is the length of the tube.<br>
  For the first resonance position, we have:<
  172.8 m/s = (0.18 m + e) x 480 Hz.<br>
  Solving for e, we get:<br>
  e = (172.8 m/s)/(480 Hz) - 0.18 m = 0.028 m.<br>
  Therefore, the end correction of the tube is 0.028 m.<br>
  Similarly, for the second resonance position, we have:<br>
  537.6 m/s = (0.56 m + e) x 480 Hz.<br>
  Solving for e, we get:<br>
  e = (537.6 m/s)/(480 Hz) - 0.56 m = -0.005 m.<br>
  Therefore, the end correction of the tube is -0.005 m. (Note: a negative end correction implies that the effective length of the tube is shorter than its actual length due to some factor, such as the presence of a small opening or a bell-shaped end.)</p>

    Let's first calculate the speed of sound in air at 17°C using the formula:
vbnet
Copy code
v = fλ

where v is the velocity of sound, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength.

Substituting the given values, we get:

v = (512 Hz) x (66.5 cm) = 34112 cm/s

Now, using the ideal gas law, we can relate the molar heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume as follows:

Cp - Cv = R

where Cp and Cv are the molar heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively, and R is the gas constant. For air at NTP, R = 8.314 J/mol K.

We can also use the following equation to relate the molar heat capacities to the speed of sound:

Cp/Cv = (γ + 1)/γ

where γ is the ratio of specific heats, γ = Cp/Cv.

Rearranging this equation, we get:

γ = Cp/Cv = (Cp - Cv)/Cv + 1

Now, using the following relation between the density, pressure, and temperature of an ideal gas:

ρ = (P M)/(R T)

where ρ is the density, P is the pressure, M is the molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We can express the speed of sound as:

v = √(γ P/ρ)

Substituting the values for air at NTP (P = 1 atm, T = 273 K, M = 28.97 g/mol), we get:

v = √(γ x 1 atm x 8.314 J/mol K x 273 K/1.293 kg/m^3 x 1000 g/kg/28.97 g/mol)

Solving for γ, we get:

Therefore, the ratio of molar heat capacities at constant pressure to constant volume at NTP is:

Cp/Cv = γ = 1.40

where v1 and T1 are the velocity and temperature at the initial state (20°C), v2 and T2 are the velocity and temperature at the final state (0°C).

Substituting the values, we get:

v2/33024 cm/s = √(273 K/293 K)

342 = v + 0.6v

Solving for v gives:

v = 213.75 m/s

Therefore, the velocity of sound at 0°C is 213.75 m/s. </p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">The interval between the flash of lightening and the sound of thunder is 2 seconds, when temperature is 10°C. How far is the storm if the velocity of sound in air at 0°C is 330 m/s?<span class="right-text"></span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in air at 10°C is 332 m/s (approx). The velocity of sound increases by approximately 0.6 m/s for every 1°C increase in temperature. Therefore, at 0°C, the velocity of sound is approximately 330 m/s. 
Let the distance between the observer and the storm be 'x' meters.

We know that the speed of sound is given by:

speed = distance / time

Therefore,

distance = speed x time

The time between the flash of lightning and the sound of thunder is 2 seconds.

So,

distance = 330 x 2

distance = 660 meters

Therefore, the storm is 660 meters away from the observer.</p>
