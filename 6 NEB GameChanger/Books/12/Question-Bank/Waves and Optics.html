      <h2 class="qa-question">1. Two wires, one of copper and other of iron, have the same diameter and carry the same
        current. In which wire will the drift velocity of electrons be more?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The drift velocity of electrons in a wire depends on the wire's resistivity, which is higher
        for iron than for copper. Therefore, the drift velocity of electrons will be higher in the copper wire than in
        the iron wire, even though they have the same diameter and carry the same current.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">2. Differentiate between fuse wire and a heating wire.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">A fuse wire is a thin wire made of a material with a low melting point that is used to
        protect electrical circuits from overloading. When the current in a circuit exceeds a safe level, the fuse wire
        melts and breaks the circuit. In contrast, a heating wire is a wire made of a material with a high resistance
        that is designed to generate heat when an electric current passes through it, such as in a toaster or an
        electric stove.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">3. Why are the pole-pieces of magnets cut into cylindrical form in a galvanometer?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The pole-pieces of magnets in a galvanometer are cut into cylindrical form to ensure that the
        magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular to the plane of the coil. This allows the coil to experience a
        maximum torque, which is necessary for accurate measurements of current.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">4. Hall voltage is much more measurable in semi-conductor than in metals. Why?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Hall voltage is more measurable in semiconductors than in metals because semiconductors have
        a smaller number of charge carriers and a higher mobility than metals. This makes it easier to measure the Hall
        voltage, which is a result of the motion of charge carriers perpendicular to a magnetic field.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">5. Explain why two parallel wires carrying current in the opposite direction repel each
        other?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Two parallel wires carrying current in the opposite direction experience a repulsive force
        because the magnetic fields produced by the currents are in opposite directions. These magnetic fields interact
        with each other, resulting in a force that pushes the wires apart.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">6. 220 V a.c. is more dangerous than 220 V d.c., why?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">220 V AC is more dangerous than 220 V DC because AC voltage alternates direction, which can
        cause the muscles to contract and relax rapidly. This can result in the person being unable to let go of the
        source of electricity, leading to a prolonged exposure to the current. In contrast, DC voltage flows in only one
        direction, causing continuous muscle contraction, which can throw the person away from the source of electricity
        and reduce the exposure time. Therefore, AC voltage is considered to be more dangerous than DC voltage.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">If the discharge tube is filled up with various gases in turn, will the discharge in all
        gases take place at the same electrode potential?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">No, the discharge in different gases will not take place at the same electrode potential. The
        electrode potential at which the discharge occurs depends on various factors, such as the nature of the gas, the
        pressure of the gas, and the distance between the electrodes. Therefore, the discharge in different gases will
        occur at different electrode potentials.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">A photon and an electron have got the same de-Broglie wave length. Explain which has
        greater total energy.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The energy of a photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the
        frequency of the photon. On the other hand, the energy of an electron is given by E = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the
        mass of the electron and v is its velocity. Since the de-Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the
        momentum of the particle, it can be said that the photon and electron in this scenario have the same momentum.
        However, since the energy of the photon depends only on its frequency and Planck's constant, while the energy of
        the electron depends on its mass and velocity, it cannot be concluded which has greater total energy without
        additional information.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">How is NOT gate realised?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">A NOT gate is also known as an inverter, and it is used to invert the input signal. The
        output of a NOT gate is the inverse of its input. A NOT gate can be realized using various electronic
        components, such as a transistor or a diode. In a transistor-based NOT gate, the input signal is applied to the
        base of the transistor, and the output is taken from the collector. When the input is high, the transistor is in
        the saturation region, and the output is low. When the input is low, the transistor is in the cut-off region,
        and the output is high. Thus, the NOT operation is achieved.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">It is said that a very powerful crane is required to lift a nuclear mass of microscopic
        size. Comment on this.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The statement is likely referring to the fact that even a small amount of nuclear material,
        such as plutonium or uranium, contains an enormous amount of energy. This energy is released through a process
        called nuclear fission, in which the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large
        amount of energy in the process. However, in order to initiate this process, the nuclear material must first be
        compressed to a critical mass. This critical mass is the minimum amount of material required to sustain a
        nuclear chain reaction. Since nuclear material is very dense, even a small amount of it can have a significant
        mass, which would require a powerful crane to lift. However, it is important to note that handling nuclear
        material requires specialized equipment and expertise, and should only be done by trained professionals in a
        controlled environment.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">11. Comment on the statement "a nucleus contains no electrons and yet can eject them."
      </h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">This statement is true. A nucleus can eject electrons in a process called beta decay. During
        beta decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron, which is then ejected from the
        nucleus. This process can also be thought of as the conversion of a down quark in the neutron into an up quark,
        which changes the neutron into a proton and causes the emission of an electron.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">12. What are the effects of pollution on living organisms?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Pollution can have a variety of harmful effects on living organisms. Air pollution, for
        example, can cause respiratory problems, such as asthma, and can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
        Water pollution can make water sources unsafe for drinking and can harm aquatic organisms. Land pollution can
        lead to soil degradation and can harm plants and animals living in the affected area. Pollution can also have
        indirect effects on organisms by altering ecosystems and food webs.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">13. How can bats fly around without colliding with objects that come in their way?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Bats use echolocation to navigate and find prey in their environment. They emit
        high-frequency sounds, which bounce off objects and return to the bat as echoes. By interpreting the echoes,
        bats can determine the location, distance, size, and shape of objects in their environment, allowing them to fly
        around without colliding with them. Bats have specialized ears and brain regions that are adapted to process the
        echoes and create a three-dimensional map of their surroundings.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">14. Longitudinal waves cannot be polarized. Why?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, cannot be polarized because their vibrations are
        along the same direction as the direction of propagation. In contrast, transverse waves, such as electromagnetic
        waves, can be polarized because their vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation, allowing
        them to be filtered and oriented in a specific direction. The polarization of waves is related to the
        orientation of their electric and magnetic fields.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">15. Differentiate between wave-front and wavelet?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">A wave-front is an imaginary surface that connects all points in a wave that are in phase,
        meaning that they have the same displacement and velocity at a given point in time. A wavelet, on the other
        hand, is a small wave or oscillation that is localized in space and time, typically with a finite duration.
        Wavelets can be used to analyze and process signals in various applications, such as image processing and data
        compression, by decomposing signals into a set of wavelets with different frequencies and scales.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">What is the difference between Fresnel and Fraunhoffer diffraction?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Fresnel diffraction occurs when the diffracting object and the screen are both at a finite
        distance from the diffracting aperture. In this case, the wavefronts are not entirely plane, and the diffracted
        waves interfere with each other in a complex manner, leading to a more intricate diffraction pattern. Fraunhofer
        diffraction, on the other hand, occurs when the diffracting object and the screen are at an infinite distance
        from the aperture. In this case, the diffracted waves are essentially parallel, and the interference pattern is
        much simpler and easier to analyze.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">State Biot and Savart's law and use it to obtain an expression for the magnetic field at
        the center of the circular coil.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Biot-Savart's law states that the magnetic field produced by a steady current in a wire is
        directly proportional to the current and the length of the wire, and inversely proportional to the distance from
        the wire.
        The expression for the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil of radius R carrying a steady current I
        is given by:
        B = (μ₀I/2R)
        where μ₀ is the permeability of free space.

        Alternatively, we can use the Biot-Savart law to obtain this expression as follows:

        Consider an infinitesimal element of the coil of length dl at a distance r from the center of the coil. The
        magnetic field dB produced by this element is given by:
        dB = (μ₀I/4πr²) (dl x ȓ)
        where ȓ is the unit vector pointing from the element to the point P at the center of the coil.

        Since the magnetic field due to each element of the coil is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, only the
        horizontal components of dB will contribute to the magnetic field at the center. Therefore, we integrate over
        the entire circumference of the coil to obtain the total magnetic field B:
        B = ∫dB = (μ₀I/4πR²) ∫dl

        Since the circumference of a circle of radius R is 2πR, the expression for B simplifies to:
        B = (μ₀I/2R)
        which is the same as the expression we obtained earlier.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">What are the categories in which magnetic materials are classified? Explain their
        differences.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Magnetic materials are classified into three categories based on their magnetic properties:
        Diamagnetic materials: These materials have no permanent magnetic moment and are not attracted to a magnetic
        field. When placed in a magnetic field, they are weakly repelled due to the induced magnetic moment in the
        opposite direction to the applied field.

        Paramagnetic materials: These materials have a permanent magnetic moment but are not magnetized in the absence
        of an external magnetic field. When placed in a magnetic field, they become weakly magnetized in the direction
        of the applied field due to the alignment of their magnetic moments with the field.

        Ferromagnetic materials: These materials have a strong permanent magnetic moment and are strongly attracted to a
        magnetic field. When placed in a magnetic field, they become strongly magnetized in the direction of the applied
        field and retain their magnetization even after the field is removed. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit
        hysteresis, which means that their magnetization lags 3. Stat Faraday's laws of electrolysis. How will you
        verify Faraday's second law experimentally?
        Show that Lenz's law is an example of conservation of energy.

      <div class="qa-block">
        <h2 class="qa-question">State Faraday's laws of electrolysis. How will you verify Faraday's second law
          experimentally?</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Faraday's first law of electrolysis states that the amount of a substance deposited on an
          electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of electric charge passed through the
          electrolyte. Faraday's second law of electrolysis states that the amounts of different substances deposited by
          the same amount of electric charge passing through the electrolyte are proportional to their chemical
          equivalent weights.
          To experimentally verify Faraday's second law, one can electroplate a metal onto a cathode using a given
          amount of charge and measure the mass of the metal deposited. Then, a different metal can be plated under the
          same conditions, and the mass of the metal deposited can be measured. By comparing the masses of the two
          metals deposited, one can confirm that they are proportional to their respective chemical equivalent weights.

      <div class="qa-block">
        <h2 class="qa-question">Show that Lenz's law is an example of conservation of energy.</h2>
        <p class="qa-answer">Lenz's law is an example of the law of conservation of energy because it states that the
          induced electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit always opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
          When a magnetic field changes near a conductor, it induces a current in the conductor. According to Lenz's
          law, the direction of the induced current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in the original
          magnetic field. This opposing magnetic field exerts a force that acts to slow down the original change in
          magnetic flux. This means that the energy required to produce the change in the original magnetic field is
          dissipated as heat in the conductor due to the induced current. Therefore, Lenz's law ensures that the energy
          produced by the original change in magnetic field is conserved, albeit in a different form.</p>

        number of the orbit.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">In Bohr's model of the atom, the electron orbits the nucleus in circular paths with quantized
        energy levels. The quantum number, n, describes the energy level of the electron. The radius of the electron
        orbit is given by the equation: r = n^2 * h^2 / 4π^2 * me * ke^2, where h is Planck's constant, me is the mass
        of the electron, ke is Coulomb's constant, and π is pi. Thus, the radius of the electronic orbit increases with
        n^2.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Define decay constant of a radioactive element. How is it related to halt-life?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The decay constant of a radioactive element is the probability of decay per unit time. It is
        denoted by the symbol λ and has units of inverse time (usually per second). The decay constant is related to the
        half-life of the element by the equation: λ = ln(2) / t1/2, where t1/2 is the half-life of the element. The
        half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of the original sample of the radioactive element to decay.
        Thus, the decay constant and half-life are mathematically related.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">Discuss a zener diode and its use as voltage stabilizer.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">A zener diode is a type of diode that is designed to operate in the reverse breakdown region
        of its characteristic curve. In this region, the diode maintains a nearly constant voltage across its terminals,
        regardless of changes in the current flowing through it. This property makes zener diodes useful as voltage
        regulators or stabilizers.
        When a zener diode is connected in parallel with a load, the voltage across the load remains nearly constant,
        even when the input voltage fluctuates. This is because the zener diode maintains a constant voltage across its
        terminals, and this voltage is applied to the load. Zener diodes are commonly used in electronic circuits to
        regulate power supply voltages, protect circuits from overvoltage conditions, and generate stable reference
        voltages.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">8. Describe a theory which accounts for the origin and evolution of the universe.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted theory that describes the origin and
        evolution of the universe. According to this theory, the universe began as a hot, dense point called a
        singularity, which expanded rapidly in a massive explosion approximately 13.8 billion years ago. As the universe
        expanded and cooled, matter began to form, and the first atoms were created. Gravity caused this matter to clump
        together, eventually forming stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. Over billions of years, the universe
        continued to expand, and galaxies continued to move away from one another. The Big Bang theory has been
        supported by a wide range of observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of
        light elements in the universe, and the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>

      <h2 class="qa-question">9. Show that both harmonics, odd and even, can be produced in an organ pipe open at both
        ends.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">An organ pipe open at both ends can produce both odd and even harmonics. The fundamental
        frequency of the pipe is determined by its length and the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. The first
        harmonic, or fundamental frequency, has a wavelength that is twice the length of the pipe. This produces a node
        at each end of the pipe and an antinode at the center. The second harmonic has a wavelength equal to the length
        of the pipe, and produces an additional node at the center of the pipe, creating two antinodes. Subsequent even
        harmonics will continue to produce nodes and antinodes at equal intervals along the length of the pipe. Odd
        harmonics, on the other hand, have a wavelength equal to 2/3 of the length of the pipe, and will produce an
        antinode at the center of the pipe and a node at each end. Therefore, both odd and even harmonics can be
        produced in an organ pipe open at both ends.</p>

        moves towards a stationary observer.</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Doppler's effect is the change in frequency of a wave (such as sound or light) due to the
        relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. When a source of sound moves towards a
        stationary observer, the frequency of the sound waves appears higher than its actual frequency, and this is
        called the apparent pitch. The expression for the apparent pitch is given by:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><em>f<sub>a</sub> = f<sub>s</sub> (v + v<sub>O</sub>) / (v - v<sub>S</sub>)</em>
      </p>
      <p>where <em>f<sub>a</sub></em> is the apparent frequency or pitch, <em>f<sub>s</sub></em> is the actual frequency
        of the sound wave, <em>v</em> is the speed of sound in the medium, <em>v<sub>O</sub></em> is the velocity of the
        observer, and <em>v<sub>S</sub></em> is the velocity of the source.</p>
      <p>If the source moves away from the stationary observer, the frequency of the sound waves appears lower than its

        this case is:</p>

    Calculation of resistance required to convert a galvanometer into an ammeter.
    <div class="qa-block">
      <h2 class="qa-question">Q13. If a galvanometer has a resistance of 9.36 ohm and a current of 0.0224 A causes it to
        deflect full scale, and we want to convert it to an ammeter reading 20.0 A full-scale using a shunt resistance
        of 0.025 ohm, what resistance R must be connected in series with the coil?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">Since the full-scale deflection of the galvanometer is caused by a current of 0.0224 A, the
        current through the ammeter at full-scale deflection will be 20.0 A minus 0.0224 A, which equals 19.9776 A. To
        achieve this, we must connect a shunt resistance of 0.025 ohm in parallel with the galvanometer. The remaining
        resistance R must be connected in series with the galvanometer to limit the current to 0.0224 A when the ammeter
        is not being used. Using the formula for parallel and series resistance, we get: R = (20.0 A/0.0224 A - 1) *
        0.025 ohm = 221.43 ohm (rounded to two decimal places).</p>

        reactance and the impedance at the resonance frequency (iii) the r.m.s. current at the resonance and (iv) the

      <p class="qa-answer">(i) Resonance frequency, fr = 1/2π√(LC) where L is the inductance and C is the capacitance.
        <br>
        fr = 1/2π√(2.5 mH * 0.1 μF) = 1591.55 Hz <br>
        (ii) Impedance at resonance frequency, Z = R + j(XL - XC) where R is the resistance, XL is the inductive
        reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance. At resonance, XL = XC. <br>
        XL = XC = 1/2πfC = 265.26 Ω <br>

        (iii) r.m.s. current at resonance, Irms = Vrms/Z where Vrms is the r.m.s. voltage of the source. <br>
        Irms = 1.9 V / 100 Ω = 0.019 A <br>
        (iv) At resonance, the impedance of the circuit is purely resistive and equal to the resistance R = 100 Ω.
        Therefore, the r.m.s. voltage across each circuit element is given by Ohm's law:

        r.m.s. voltage across the resistor = Irms * R = 0.019 A * 100 Ω = 1.9 V
        r.m.s. voltage across the inductor = Irms * XL = 0.019 A * 265.26 Ω = 5.03694 V
        r.m.s. voltage across the capacitor = Irms * XC = 0.019 A * 265.26 Ω = 5.03694 V
        Note that the r.m.s. voltage across the inductor and capacitor is the same because they have equal reactance at
        resonance.

        by a nuclear reactor of efficiency 20% using 92U235 as the fuel. Calculate the amount of fuel required for one
        day's operation. (Given: energy released per fission of 92U235 200 MeV).</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">The amount of energy required to generate 10^8 watts of power for one day is:<br>
        Power = 10^8 watts x 24 hours = 2.4 x 10^9 watt-hours (Wh)<br>
        One fission of 92U235 releases 200 MeV = 3.2 x 10^-11 Wh of energy<br>
        The efficiency of the nuclear reactor is 20%, so the energy actually produced is:<br>
        Energy produced = 0.20 x 2.4 x 10^9 Wh = 4.8 x 10^8 Wh<br>
        Therefore, the number of fissions required per day is:<br>
        Number of fissions = Energy produced / Energy per fission = (4.8 x 10^8 Wh) / (3.2 x 10^-11 Wh/fission) = 1.5 x
        10^19 fissions<br>
        The amount of 92U235 required for this many fissions is:<br>
        Amount of 92U235 = Number of fissions / Fissions per unit mass = 1.5 x 10^19 fissions / (200 MeV/fission x (1.6
        x 10^-13 J/MeV) x (1 kg/2.56 x 10^19 fissions)) = 7.8 kg<br>

        other?</h2>
      <p class="qa-answer">
        Let the index of refraction of water be denoted as 'n1' and the index of refraction of glass be denoted as 'n2'.
        arduino
        Copy code
        Using Snell's law, we have:
        n1*sin(theta1) = n2*sin(theta2)

        where theta1 is the angle of incidence and theta2 is the angle of refraction in the glass.

        At the point of incidence, the incident ray, the refracted ray, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane.
        Therefore, the angle of reflection is also 53°.

        Now, applying the law of reflection, we have:
        theta2 = theta1 = 53°

        Thus, n1*sin(53°) = n2*sin(53°)
        => n2 = n1/sin(53°)

        Let the angle between the reflected and refracted rays be denoted as 'x'.

        Using the laws of trigonometry, we have:
        sin(x) = sin(90°-theta2) = cos(theta2)

        Since the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane, the angle of
        reflection is also equal to 'x'.

        Thus, sin(x) = sin(53°)

        Substituting the value of 'x' and 'n2' from the above equations, we get:

        sin(cos⁻¹(n1/sin(53°))) = sin(53°)

        Solving the above equation, we get:

        n1 = 1.50 (approx.)

        Therefore, the index of refraction of glass is approximately 1.50.

  <h2 class="qa-question">What is a wave motion? Derive progressive wave equation in a medium. <span class="right-text">[2072 Set C Q.No. 7a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Wave motion is the propagation of a disturbance through a medium, in which energy is transferred from one point to another without any physical transport of matter. 
The general equation for a progressive wave in a medium is given as:

  <center>y = A sin(2&pi;/&lambda; x - 2&pi; f t + &phi;)</center>
where:

  <ul>
    <li>y = displacement of the wave</li>
    <li>A = amplitude of the wave</li>
    <li>&lambda; = wavelength of the wave</li>
    <li>x = position of the wave</li>
    <li>f = frequency of the wave</li>
    <li>t = time</li>
    <li>&phi; = phase angle</li>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Define progressive waves. Derive an equation to represent this wave. <span class="right-text">[2072 Set E Q.No. 7a/ 2066 Supp Q.No 5a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Progressive waves are a type of wave that propagate through a medium and transfer energy from one point to another without any net displacement of the medium. The disturbance created in the medium is propagated forward as a series of crests and troughs, with the wave moving in the direction of the crests.
The general equation for a progressive wave is given as:

  <center>y = A sin(kx - &omega;t + &phi;)</center>
where:

  <ul>
    <li>y = displacement of the wave</li>
    <li>A = amplitude of the wave</li>
    <li>k = wave number</li>
    <li>x = position of the wave</li>

  <h2 class="qa-question">How is a progressive wave different from a stationary wave? Derive an equation for a progressive wave.<span class="right-text">[2074 Set B Q.No. 7a/ 2070 Set D Q.No. 7a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">A progressive wave is a type of wave that moves through a medium and transports energy from one point to another without any permanent displacement of the medium. In contrast, a stationary wave is a wave that appears to stay in one place and oscillates in amplitude, but does not propagate through the medium.
The general equation for a progressive wave is given by y(x, t) = A sin(kx - ωt), where y is the displacement of the medium at position x and time t, A is the amplitude of the wave, k is the wave number (2π/λ), λ is the wavelength, ω is the angular frequency (2πf), and f is the frequency of the wave. </p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Progressive waves are waves that travel through a medium and transport energy from one point to another without any permanent displacement of the medium. They are characterized by their amplitude, frequency, wavelength, and wave speed.

  <h2 class="qa-question">State and explain the stationary wave.<span class="right-text">[2063 Q.No. 6a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">A stationary wave is a wave pattern that appears to remain in a constant position and does not propagate through space. It is formed by the superposition of two waves of equal frequency and amplitude travelling in opposite directions. The points where the amplitude of the wave is maximum are called antinodes, and the points where the amplitude is minimum (zero) are called nodes. In a stationary wave, the energy is not transported from one point to another, but it is rather stored in the medium in the form of potential energy.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Use the principle of superposition of two waves to find the position of nodes and antinodes in a standing wave.<span class="right-text">[2061 Q.No. 5a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">When two waves of equal frequency and amplitude travelling in opposite directions interfere, they produce a standing wave. The principle of superposition states that the displacement of the medium at any point is the algebraic sum of the displacements due to each wave. The resulting pattern of the standing wave has nodes and antinodes at specific positions.
The nodes are formed at the points where the two waves interfere destructively, resulting in a minimum amplitude. The antinodes, on the other hand, are formed at the points where the two waves interfere constructively, resulting in a maximum amplitude.

The position of the nodes and antinodes can be found using the formula:

For a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends,

The distance between two adjacent nodes or two adjacent antinodes is equal to half the wavelength of the wave.

The distance between a node and an adjacent antinode is equal to one-fourth of the wavelength of the wave.

  <p class="qa-answer">The given wave equation is y = 0.02 sin (30t - 4x), which represents a sinusoidal wave traveling in the negative x-direction with an amplitude of 0.02 m, a frequency of 15 Hz (calculated as 30/(2π)), and a wavelength of 4/π m (calculated as 2π/4). The speed of the wave can be calculated as the product of frequency and wavelength, which gives 60/π m/s (approximately 19.1 m/s).<br>
  The equation of the wave with double amplitude traveling in the opposite direction can be written as y = -0.04 sin (30t + 4x).</p>
