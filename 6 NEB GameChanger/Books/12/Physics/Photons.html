      <h2>Quantum Nature of Radiation</h2>

      <p>Radiation, including electromagnetic waves such as light, exhibits particle-like behavior known as the quantum nature of radiation. This behavior is explained by quantum theory, which describes the behavior of particles and waves at the atomic and subatomic level.</p>
      
      <h3>Particle-Particle Duality</h3>
      
      <p>According to quantum theory, radiation can behave both as particles and as waves. This is known as particle-wave duality. In certain experiments, radiation behaves like particles called photons, while in other experiments, it behaves like waves characterized by wavelength and frequency.</p>
      
      <p>The energy of a photon is given by the equation:</p>
      
      <p class="formula">E = hf</p>
      
      <p>Where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the radiation.</p>
      
      <h3>Quantization of Energy</h3>
      
      <p>Quantum theory also introduced the concept of energy quantization, which states that energy is not continuous but exists in discrete packets or quanta. This is evident in the emission and absorption of radiation, where energy is exchanged in discrete amounts.</p>
      
      <p>For example, when an atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between the two levels.</p>
      
      <h3>Photoelectric Effect</h3>
      
      <p>The photoelectric effect is another phenomenon that supports the quantum nature of radiation. It involves the ejection of electrons from a material when exposed to light. The intensity and frequency of light affect the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons, but the number of electrons depends on the intensity alone.</p>
      
      <p>The photoelectric effect cannot be explained by classical wave theory but can be understood using the particle-like nature of photons. Photons with sufficient energy can transfer their energy to electrons, causing them to be ejected from the material.</p>
      
      <p>These experimental observations and theoretical explanations demonstrate the quantum nature of radiation, highlighting the dual particle-wave behavior and the quantization of energy. Quantum theory revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of radiation and laid the foundation for modern physics.</p>
      
      <h2>Einstein's Photoelectric Equation and Stopping Potential</h2>

      <p>Einstein's photoelectric equation describes the relationship between the energy of a photon and the kinetic energy of an ejected electron in the photoelectric effect.</p>
      
      <h3>Einstein's Photoelectric Equation</h3>
      
      <p>The equation is given by:</p>
      
      <p class="formula">$E = hf = \phi + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$</p>
      
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$E$ is the energy of the incident photon</li>
        <li>$h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ JÂ·s)</li>
        <li>$f$ is the frequency of the incident light</li>
        <li>$\phi$ is the work function (minimum energy required to remove an electron from the material)</li>
        <li>$m$ is the mass of the electron</li>
        <li>$v$ is the velocity of the ejected electron</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>According to the photoelectric effect, if the energy of the incident photon ($E$) is less than the work function ($\phi$), no electrons will be emitted. When the energy of the incident photon is equal to or greater than the work function, electrons are emitted with a certain kinetic energy.</p>
      
      <h3>Stopping Potential</h3>
      
      <p>The stopping potential ($V_s$) is the minimum potential difference required to completely stop the ejected electrons. It is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.</p>
      
      <p>The stopping potential can be calculated using the equation:</p>
      
      <p class="formula">$V_s = \frac{hf}{e}$</p>
      
      <p>Where $e$ is the elementary charge ($1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C).</p>
      
      <p>The stopping potential depends on the frequency of the incident light. If the frequency is below the threshold frequency, no electrons are emitted, and the stopping potential is zero.</p>
      
      <p>By studying Einstein's photoelectric equation and the concept of stopping potential, we can understand the behavior of electrons in the photoelectric effect and gain insights into the quantum nature of light and matter.</p>
      <h2>Measurement of Planck's Constant</h2>

<p>Planck's constant ($h$) is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. The value of Planck's constant was determined through various experiments, with one of the most notable being the measurement of the photoelectric effect.</p>

<h3>The Photoelectric Effect</h3>

<p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. The energy of the incident photons determines whether electrons can be emitted or not.</p>

<p>In order to measure Planck's constant, a setup involving the photoelectric effect is used. The following steps are typically followed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A photosensitive material (e.g., a metal surface) is selected for the experiment.</li>
  <li>A potential difference (voltage) is applied across the photosensitive material, creating an electric field.</li>
  <li>The frequency of the incident light is varied, while keeping the intensity (brightness) of the light constant.</li>
  <li>The stopping potential (minimum potential required to stop the emitted electrons) is measured for different frequencies of light.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Measurement of Planck's Constant</h3>

<p>Using the photoelectric effect setup, Planck's constant can be calculated using the equation:</p>

<p class="formula">$hf = \phi + eV_s$</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$h$ is Planck's constant</li>
  <li>$f$ is the frequency of the incident light</li>
  <li>$\phi$ is the work function of the photosensitive material</li>
  <li>$e$ is the elementary charge</li>
  <li>$V_s$ is the stopping potential</li>
</ul>

<p>By measuring the stopping potential for different frequencies of light and plotting the data, the slope of the graph is equal to Planck's constant ($h$).</p>

<p>Several experimental techniques, such as the use of different photosensitive materials and precise measurements of the stopping potential, are employed to obtain accurate values of Planck's constant.</p>

<p>Through the measurement of Planck's constant, scientists have gained a deeper understanding of the quantum nature of light and the particle-like behavior of photons.</p>
