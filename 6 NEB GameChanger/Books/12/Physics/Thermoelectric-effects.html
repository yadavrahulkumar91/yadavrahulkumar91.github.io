      <h2>Seebeck Effect</h2>

      <p>The Seebeck effect is a phenomenon where a temperature gradient across two dissimilar conductors or semiconductors generates an electromotive force (EMF) or voltage. It is the basis of operation for thermocouples, which are widely used for temperature measurement.</p>
      
      <p>When two different materials are connected at two junctions, and there is a temperature difference between the junctions, an electric potential is generated. This electric potential arises due to the difference in the Seebeck coefficients of the materials, which is a measure of how much voltage is generated per unit temperature difference.</p>
      
      <p>The Seebeck effect can be mathematically represented as:</p>
      
      \[ V = S \cdot \Delta T \]
      
      where:
      - $ V $ is the generated voltage or EMF,
      - $S $ is the Seebeck coefficient or thermoelectric power of the material,
      - $ \Delta T $ is the temperature difference between the two junctions.</p>
      
      <p>The Seebeck effect has various applications, with one of the most common being thermocouples.</p>
      
      <h2>Thermocouples</h2>
      
      <p>A thermocouple is a device used for temperature measurement based on the Seebeck effect. It consists of two dissimilar metal wires or conductors joined at one end to form a junction. The other ends of the wires are connected to a measuring instrument or a temperature controller.</p>
      
      <p>When the junction of a thermocouple is exposed to a temperature gradient, an EMF is generated due to the Seebeck effect. This EMF is proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions. By measuring the generated voltage, the temperature can be determined using calibration curves or tables specific to the thermocouple type.</p>
      
      <p>Thermocouples are widely used for temperature sensing in various industries and applications, including industrial processes, HVAC systems, scientific research, and temperature control systems. They offer advantages such as wide temperature range, ruggedness, fast response time, and compatibility with different environments.</p>
      <h2>Peltier Effect</h2>

<p>The Peltier effect is a thermoelectric phenomenon where the application of a direct current (DC) through a junction of two dissimilar materials causes a temperature difference across the junction. It is the reverse of the Seebeck effect and is named after the French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier.</p>

<p>When an electric current flows through a Peltier junction consisting of two different materials, heat is either absorbed or released at the junction, depending on the direction of the current. This phenomenon occurs due to the transfer of energy carried by charge carriers (electrons or holes) as they move from one material to another.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the heat transfer in the Peltier effect is proportional to the current passing through the junction. The direction of heat transfer depends on the direction of the current flow. By controlling the current, the Peltier effect can be used to either cool or heat the junction.</p>

<h2>Variation of Thermoelectric EMF with Temperature</h2>

<p>The thermoelectric electromotive force (EMF) generated by the Peltier effect is dependent on the temperature difference across the junction. The relationship between the EMF and the temperature difference can be characterized by a coefficient called the Peltier coefficient, denoted as \( \Pi \).</p>

<p>The variation of thermoelectric EMF with temperature can be expressed as:</p>

\[ \Delta V = \Pi \cdot \Delta T \]

where:
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in voltage or EMF,
- \( \Pi \) is the Peltier coefficient, and
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference.</p>

<p>The Peltier effect finds applications in various cooling and heating systems, such as thermoelectric coolers, heat pumps, and temperature control devices.</p>

<h2>Thermopile</h2>

<p>A thermopile is a device composed of multiple thermocouples connected in series or parallel to increase the generated voltage. It utilizes the Peltier effect to measure temperature or generate electrical power. The thermopile consists of multiple junctions arranged in a series or parallel configuration to enhance the overall thermoelectric output.</p>

<p>The thermopile is commonly used in applications where a small temperature difference needs to be measured or converted into electrical energy. It is widely employed in infrared thermometers, gas burners, temperature sensors, and energy harvesting devices.</p>
