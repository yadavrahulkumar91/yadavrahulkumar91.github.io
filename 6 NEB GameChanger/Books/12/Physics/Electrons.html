        <h2>Milikan's Oil Drop Experiment</h2>

        <p>Milikan's oil drop experiment is a famous experiment conducted by Robert A. Millikan in 1909 to determine the charge of an electron. The experiment involved observing the motion of tiny oil droplets in an electric field and gravitational field.</p>
        
        <h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
        
        <p>In the experiment, Millikan introduced oil droplets into a chamber where they could freely fall due to gravity. A mist of oil droplets was created by spraying oil into the chamber. Some of these droplets acquired an electric charge due to ionization caused by radiation.</p>
        
        <p>The oil droplets were then observed under a microscope. By applying a known electric field to the chamber, Millikan was able to control the motion of the droplets. He adjusted the electric field strength to balance the gravitational force acting on the droplets, causing them to remain suspended or fall at a constant velocity.</p>
        
        <h3>Measurement and Analysis</h3>
        
        <p>Millikan carefully measured the fall and rise velocities of the oil droplets using a microscope and recorded their motion. By equating the electric force and gravitational force acting on the droplets, he was able to determine the charge on each droplet.</p>
        
        <p>Using this data, Millikan discovered that the charge on the oil droplets was quantized, meaning that the charges were multiples of a fundamental unit of charge. Through careful analysis and statistical methods, he was able to determine the value of the fundamental unit of charge, which was later identified as the charge of an electron.</p>
        
        <h3>Significance and Impact</h3>
        
        <p>Milikan's oil drop experiment provided the first direct measurement of the charge of an electron and confirmed the existence of quantized charge. The experiment played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of atomic structure and the nature of electrical charge.</p>
        
        <p>The results of Milikan's experiment were significant in supporting the development of the atomic model and the theory of electromagnetism. It also contributed to the later development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of subatomic particles.</p>
        
        <p>Millikan's oil drop experiment stands as a landmark in the field of physics and remains a testament to the precision and ingenuity of experimental science.</p>

        <h2>Motion of Electron Beam in Electric and Magnetic Fields</h2>

<p>When an electron beam is subjected to electric and magnetic fields, its motion is influenced by the interaction between these fields and the charge and mass of the electrons.</p>

<h3>Motion in Electric Field</h3>

<p>When an electron beam enters an electric field, it experiences a force due to the electric field. The force on the electron is given by:</p>

<p class="formula">$\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$</p>

<p>Where $\vec{F}$ is the force on the electron, $q$ is the charge of the electron, and $\vec{E}$ is the electric field vector.</p>

<p>The direction of the force depends on the polarity of the electric field and the charge of the electron. If the electric field is directed from positive to negative, the force on the electron is in the opposite direction, i.e., towards the positive side.</p>

<h3>Motion in Magnetic Field</h3>

<p>When an electron beam enters a magnetic field, it experiences a force due to the magnetic field. The force on the electron is given by:</p>

<p class="formula">$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$</p>

<p>Where $\vec{F}$ is the force on the electron, $q$ is the charge of the electron, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector of the electron, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector.</p>

<p>The direction of the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the electron and the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force depends on the charge of the electron, its velocity, and the strength of the magnetic field.</p>

<h3>Combined Motion</h3>

<p>When both electric and magnetic fields are present, the electron beam experiences a combined effect of these fields. The motion of the electron beam can be described by the Lorentz force equation:</p>

<p class="formula">$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})$</p>

<p>The motion of the electron beam depends on the relative strengths and orientations of the electric and magnetic fields.</p>

<p>By controlling the electric and magnetic fields, the trajectory of the electron beam can be manipulated, allowing for various applications such as electron microscopy, particle accelerators, and cathode-ray tubes.</p>

<h2>Thomson's Experiment to Determine Specific Charge of Electrons</h2>

<p>In the late 19th century, J.J. Thomson conducted an experiment known as the cathode ray tube experiment to determine the specific charge of electrons. This experiment provided strong evidence for the existence of electrons and their fundamental properties.</p>

<h3>Experimental Setup</h3>

<p>The experimental setup consisted of a cathode ray tube, which is a partially evacuated glass tube with two metal electrodes: a cathode (negatively charged electrode) and an anode (positively charged electrode).</p>

<p>When a high voltage is applied between the cathode and the anode, a ray of negatively charged particles called cathode rays is produced. These cathode rays are actually streams of electrons.</p>

<h3>Deflection of Cathode Rays</h3>

<p>Thomson observed that when an electric field was applied perpendicular to the path of the cathode rays using external plates, the rays were deflected towards the positive plate, indicating that the cathode rays were negatively charged.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the path of the cathode rays using external magnets, the rays were deflected in a circular path, indicating that the cathode rays were charged particles with mass.</p>

<h3>Measurement of Deflection</h3>

<p>Thomson used electric and magnetic fields to measure the deflection of the cathode rays. By varying the electric and magnetic field strengths and measuring the resulting deflection, he was able to determine the ratio of the charge to the mass of the cathode rays.</p>

<p>From his experiments, Thomson determined the specific charge ($e/m$) of the electrons, where $e$ is the charge of the electron and $m$ is its mass. He found that the specific charge of electrons was constant regardless of the nature of the gas in the cathode ray tube.</p>

<p>This experiment provided strong evidence for the existence of electrons as subatomic particles and led to the development of the electron as a fundamental particle in atomic structure.</p>
