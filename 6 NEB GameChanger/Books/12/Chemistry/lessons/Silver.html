        <h1>7.5 Silver</h1>
        <h2>7.5.1 Occurrence and Extraction of Silver by Cyanide Process</h2>
        <p>Silver is a precious metal that occurs naturally in various ores and minerals. One of the main ores of silver is argentite (Ag<sub>2</sub>S). The extraction of silver from argentite involves the following steps using the cyanide process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Grinding and Concentration: The argentite ore is first crushed into small pieces and then concentrated by froth flotation or gravity separation methods to obtain a silver-rich concentrate.</li>
          <li>Roasting: The concentrated ore is then roasted in the presence of air, converting silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) to silver oxide (Ag<sub>2</sub>O) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gas.</li>
          <li>Leaching: The roasted ore is subjected to leaching with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide (NaCN) in the presence of air. Silver cyanide (AgCN) forms as a soluble complex.</li>
          <li>Precipitation: The silver cyanide solution is treated with a suitable reagent, such as zinc (Zn), to precipitate metallic silver (Ag) while regenerating sodium cyanide for reuse.</li>
          <li>Refining: The obtained metallic silver is further purified through processes such as electrolysis or chemical refining to remove impurities and obtain high-quality silver.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>7.5.2 Preparation and Uses of Silver Chloride and Silver Nitrate</h2>
        <p>Silver chloride (AgCl) and silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) are two important compounds of silver with various applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Silver Chloride (AgCl):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preparation: Silver chloride can be prepared by the reaction of silver nitrate with a chloride source, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). The resulting white precipitate is silver chloride.</li>
            <li>Uses: Silver chloride has been historically used in photography as a light-sensitive material. It is also used in certain medical applications and as a component in some silver-based electrical conductive pastes.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Silver Nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preparation: Silver nitrate can be prepared by dissolving metallic silver in nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>). The resulting solution is silver nitrate.</li>
            <li>Uses: Silver nitrate has various applications, including its use in photography, silver plating, and as a reagent in chemical laboratories. It is also used in the production of certain mirrors, jewelry, and medical products.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
