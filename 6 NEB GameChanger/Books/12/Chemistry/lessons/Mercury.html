        <h1>7.3 Mercury</h1>
        <h2>7.3.1 Occurrence and Extraction of Mercury from Cinnabar</h2>
        <p>Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is often found in the form of cinnabar (HgS), a red ore. The extraction of mercury from cinnabar involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Crushing and Roasting: The cinnabar ore is first crushed into a fine powder and then heated in the presence of air. The roasting process converts cinnabar into mercury vapor and sulfur dioxide gas.</li>
          <li>Condensation: The mercury vapor is then cooled and condensed to form liquid mercury. The condensation is usually done in a condenser or a series of condensers.</li>
          <li>Purification: The obtained liquid mercury is further purified to remove impurities such as sulfur and other metals.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>7.3.2 Properties of Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury possesses several unique properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical State: Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature and standard pressure.</li>
          <li>Density: It is a dense liquid with a high density of about 13.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, making it over 13 times denser than water.</li>
          <li>Low Melting and Boiling Point: Mercury has a low melting point of -38.83°C and a boiling point of 356.73°C.</li>
          <li>Poor Electrical and Thermal Conductivity: Mercury is a poor conductor of both electricity and heat compared to other metals.</li>
          <li>High Surface Tension: It exhibits a high surface tension, allowing it to form spherical droplets.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7.3.3 Chemistry (Preparation, Properties, and Uses) of Calomel and Corrosive Sublimate</h2>
        <p>Calomel and corrosive sublimate are two important compounds of mercury with distinct properties and applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calomel (Mercurous Chloride, Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preparation: Calomel can be prepared by the reaction of mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) with a reducing agent such as metallic mercury.</li>
            <li>Properties: Calomel is a white crystalline powder that is insoluble in water. It is used as a mild laxative and in certain electrochemical applications.</li>
            <li>Uses: Calomel has been historically used in medicine as a purgative and as an electrode in certain types of electrochemical cells.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Corrosive Sublimate (Mercuric Chloride, HgCl<sub>2</sub>):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Preparation: Corrosive sublimate can be prepared by the reaction of mercury with chlorine gas.</li>
            <li>Properties: Corrosive sublimate is a white crystalline solid that is highly toxic. It is soluble in water and has strong antiseptic properties.</li>
            <li>Uses: Corrosive sublimate has been used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and pesticide. However, due to its toxicity, its use has been restricted in many countries.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
