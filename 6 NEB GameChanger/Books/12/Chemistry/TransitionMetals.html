      <h1>6. Transition Metals</h1>
      <h2>6.1 Introduction</h2>
      <h3>6.1.1 Characteristics of Transition Metals</h3>
      <p>Transition metals are a group of elements located in the middle of the periodic table, specifically in the d-block. They possess several characteristic properties, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variable oxidation states: Transition metals can exhibit multiple oxidation states due to the availability of d-orbitals for electron transfer.</li>
        <li>Complex formation: Transition metals have the ability to form complex ions and coordinate compounds due to their partially filled d-orbitals.</li>
        <li>Colored compounds: Transition metal compounds often exhibit vibrant colors, providing an interesting field of study in coordination chemistry.</li>
        <li>Paramagnetism: Many transition metals and their compounds are paramagnetic, meaning they are attracted to magnetic fields.</li>
        <li>High melting and boiling points: Transition metals generally have higher melting and boiling points compared to elements in other blocks of the periodic table.</li>
        <li>Good conductors of heat and electricity: Transition metals are excellent conductors of heat and electricity due to the mobility of their delocalized electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>6.1.2 Oxidation States of Transition Metals</h3>
      <p>Transition metals exhibit a range of oxidation states due to the variable filling of their d-orbitals. They can form cations by losing electrons or anions by gaining electrons. Some transition metals commonly display multiple oxidation states, allowing them to participate in various chemical reactions.</p>
      <p>For example, iron (Fe) can exhibit oxidation states of +2 and +3, while copper (Cu) can have oxidation states of +1 and +2. The different oxidation states enable transition metals to form a wide variety of compounds and engage in redox reactions.</p>
      <h3>6.1.3 Complex Ions and Metal Complexes</h3>
      <p>Transition metals have a unique ability to form complex ions and coordinate compounds. These complexes are formed through the coordination of ligands, which are molecules or ions that donate a pair of electrons to the metal ion.</p>
      <p>The resulting coordination complexes consist of a central metal ion bonded to one or more ligands. The coordination number represents the number of ligands attached to the central metal ion. Common coordination numbers for transition metal complexes include 4, 6, and 8.</p>
      <h3>6.1.4 Shapes of Complex Ions</h3>
      <p>The shapes of complex ions are influenced by the coordination number and the type of ligands surrounding the central metal ion. The two most common shapes for transition metal complexes are octahedral and tetrahedral.</p>
      <p>Octahedral complexes have a coordination number of 6 and exhibit a geometry similar to two pyramids attached at their bases. The central metal ion is surrounded by six ligands, positioned at the corners of an octahedron.</p>
      <h3>6.1.5 d-Orbitals in Complex Ions (Simple Explanation by Crystal Field Theory) for Octahedral Complex</h3>
      <p>The crystal field theory provides a simple explanation for the electronic structure and color of transition metal complexes. In octahedral complexes, the metal ion's d-orbitals split into two sets of energy levels in the presence of surrounding ligands.</p>
      <p>The lower-energy set of d-orbitals, called t<sub>2g</sub>, experiences greater electron-electron repulsion as the ligands approach. Therefore, they are lower in energy. The higher-energy set, called e<sub>g</sub>, experiences less electron-electron repulsion and is higher in energy.</p>
      <p>The absorption of light by transition metal complexes occurs when electrons in the lower-energy t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals are promoted to the higher-energy e<sub>g</sub> orbitals. The absorbed light corresponds to specific wavelengths, resulting in the observed colors of transition metal compounds.</p>
      <h3>6.1.6 Reasons for the Color of Transition Metal Compounds</h3>
      <p>The color of transition metal compounds arises from the absorption of light in the visible spectrum. The absorbed wavelengths correspond to the energy difference between different electron transitions within the d-orbitals of the metal ion.</p>
      <p>Each transition metal ion and its corresponding complex exhibit a unique color due to the specific arrangement of ligands and the resulting energy differences between the d-orbitals. The color observed is complementary to the absorbed wavelength, as the remaining wavelengths are reflected or transmitted, giving rise to the perceived color.</p>
      <h3>6.1.7 Catalytic Properties of Transition Metals</h3>
      <p>Transition metals are known for their catalytic properties. They can facilitate chemical reactions by providing a surface for the reaction to occur or by actively participating in the reaction through electron transfer.</p>
      <p>The catalytic activity of transition metals is often attributed to their ability to change oxidation states easily, enabling them to accept or donate electrons during the reaction process. Additionally, their variable oxidation states allow for the formation of intermediate species that facilitate the reaction pathway.</p>
      <p>Transition metals find extensive use as catalysts in various industrial processes, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and polymerization reactions.</p>
