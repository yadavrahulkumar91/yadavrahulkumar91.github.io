  <h2 class="qa-question">Velocity of sound in solids in more than that in liquids, why?<span class="right-text">[2074 Set B Q.No. 3a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in solids is more than that in liquids due to the higher elasticity of solids. Solids have a higher modulus of elasticity than liquids, which means that they can deform and return to their original shape more quickly. This allows sound waves to travel faster through solids than through liquids.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">The velocity of sound in solid is generally greater than that in gas at STP. Why? Give reason.<span class="right-text">[2073 Set C Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in solids is generally greater than that in gases at STP due to the higher density and modulus of elasticity of solids. The density of solids is much higher than that of gases, which means that the molecules in solids are closer together and can transmit sound waves more effectively. In addition, the modulus of elasticity of solids is also higher, allowing sound waves to travel more quickly through them.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">When sound waves travel through a medium, does the temperature at various points remain constant? Explain.<span class="right-text">[2072 Set C Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">When sound waves travel through a medium, the temperature at various points does not remain constant. As the sound waves propagate, they produce compressions and rarefactions in the medium, which cause changes in pressure and temperature. The compressions lead to an increase in pressure and temperature, while rarefactions lead to a decrease in pressure and temperature. These changes are small and usually not noticeable, but they do occur.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Why does sound travel faster in metals than in air?<span class="right-text">[2071 Set D Q.No. 3a/ 2066 Supp Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Sound travels faster in metals than in air because the speed of sound is directly proportional to the elasticity and density of the medium. Metals have higher densities and greater elasticities compared to air, allowing sound waves to travel faster through them.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">The speed of sound in humid air is more than that in dry air, why?<span class="right-text">[2070 Supp. Set B Q.No. 3a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in humid air is more than that in dry air because water vapor, which is present in humid air, has a lower molecular weight than nitrogen and oxygen, which are the main constituents of dry air. This lower molecular weight of water vapor makes the air less dense, allowing sound waves to travel through it faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Although the density of solid is high, the velocity of sound is greater in solid, explain.<span class="right-text">[2070 Set C Q.No. 3a/ 2063 Q.No. 2a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound is greater in solids than in liquids and gases because solids have higher elasticity and intermolecular forces. These properties enable sound waves to propagate more quickly through a solid medium as the molecules are more closely packed together, and the restoring forces are stronger, leading to a faster transmission of energy. Although the density of solids is high, the strong intermolecular forces and compact arrangement of molecules allow for faster sound propagation.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Is it possible that the velocity of sound is greater in solid than that in a gas at STP? Justify your answer. <span class="right-text">[2069 Supp Set B Q.No. 3b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    Yes, it is possible for the velocity of sound to be greater in a solid than in a gas at STP. This is because the velocity of sound depends on the properties of the medium, such as its density, elasticity, and temperature. Solids are denser and more elastic than gases, and therefore sound travels faster through solids than through gases. At the same temperature and pressure, the average speed of sound in air at sea level is about 343 meters per second, while in some solids like steel it can be as high as 6100 meters per second.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Velocity of sound increases on a cloudy day. Why? <span class="right-text">[2066 Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    On a cloudy day, the temperature of the air near the surface of the earth is generally warmer than the temperature of the air higher up in the atmosphere. This is because the clouds trap the heat radiated from the earth's surface, leading to a decrease in temperature with altitude. As sound waves travel faster in warmer air, the velocity of sound increases on a cloudy day when the air near the surface of the earth is warmer. Therefore, sound waves travel faster through the lower layers of the atmosphere on a cloudy day, resulting in an increase in the velocity of sound.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Sound at a distance can be heard distinctly at night than in the day time. Why? <span class="right-text">[2065 Q.No. 1c/ 2060 Q.No. 2c/ 2052 Q.No. 1c]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">
    During the day, the temperature of the atmosphere is generally warmer near the surface of the earth and decreases with altitude. This creates a gradient in the refractive index of the air, which bends sound waves away from the surface of the earth and disperses them. This causes sound waves to become weaker as they travel and makes it difficult to hear sounds from a distance. 
At night, the temperature of the atmosphere near the surface of the earth cools faster than the temperature higher up in the atmosphere, which leads to an inversion in the refractive index gradient. This causes sound waves to bend towards the surface of the earth and focus them towards the listener. Therefore, sound waves can be heard distinctly at night than in the day time, especially over long distances.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Explain why the velocity of sound in solids is greater than that in gases, though the densities of solids are greater than that of gases. [2064 Q.No. 2d]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound in a medium depends on the elasticity and density of the medium. Solids have a higher elasticity than gases, which means that they can transmit sound waves more efficiently. Although the densities of solids are greater than that of gases, the increased elasticity more than compensates for this, resulting in a higher velocity of sound in solids than in gases.</p>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Do sound waves need a medium to travel from one point to other point in space? What properties of the medium are relevant? [2062 Q.No. 1c]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Yes, sound waves require a medium to travel through. This is because sound waves are mechanical waves that require the particles of the medium to vibrate in order to propagate. The properties of the medium that are relevant for sound wave propagation are its density, elasticity, and viscosity. In general, sound waves travel faster in denser and more elastic media, and slower in more viscous media.</p>
</div>
<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Why are sounds heard better on a wet day than on a dry day? [2056 Q.No. 1c]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Sounds are heard better on a wet day than on a dry day because the moisture in the air increases the speed of sound. This is because the water molecules in humid air are closer together, which means that sound waves can propagate more quickly through the air. In addition, the water droplets in the air can absorb sound waves and prevent them from dissipating, which can make sounds appear louder and clearer.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa-block">
  <h2 class="qa-question">Is velocity of sound more in damp air or in dry air? Explain.<span class="right-text">[2054 Q.No. 1b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The velocity of sound is generally greater in dry air than in damp air. This is because the density of damp air is higher than that of dry air, which makes it more difficult for sound waves to travel through damp air. Additionally, water molecules in damp air can absorb some of the energy of sound waves, which further reduces the speed of sound.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Discuss Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in air and explain why and how this formula was modified by Laplace.<span class="right-text">[2076 GIE Set B Q.No. 7a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in air is v = √(γP/ρ), where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, P is the pressure of the gas, and ρ is the density of the gas. This formula assumes that the gas behaves as a perfect gas, which is not always the case. Laplace modified this formula by taking into account the compressibility of air, which affects the speed of sound. Laplace's formula is v = √(γP/ρ) * (1 + (B/MP)), where B is the bulk modulus of the gas, M is the molecular weight of the gas, and P is the pressure of the gas.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Does the propagation of sound wave cause change in thermodynamic condition of medium? Derive Laplace formula of velocity of sound in air.<span class="right-text">[2076 Set B Q.No. 7a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The propagation of a sound wave can cause changes in the thermodynamic conditions of the medium, such as changes in pressure, temperature, and density. This is because the wave compresses and rarefies the medium as it travels through it, which can result in changes in the thermodynamic properties of the medium.
Laplace's formula for the velocity of sound in air is v = √(γP/ρ) * (1 + (B/MP)), where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, P is the pressure of the gas, ρ is the density of the gas, B is the bulk modulus of the gas, and M is the molecular weight of the gas.

This formula assumes that the gas is perfectly elastic and that there is no heat transfer during the propagation of sound waves. However, this assumption is not always valid, and the formula needs to be corrected. Laplace's correction takes into account the thermal expansion of the gas due to changes in temperature and pressure. It is given by:

  <p class="qa-answer">Laplace's correction in Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in air takes into account the thermal expansion of air due to changes in temperature and pressure. It is given by:
  <br><br>
  <center><b>v = √(γP/ρ) [1 + αT]</b></center>
  <br>
  where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of air and T is the temperature of the air in kelvins. The coefficient of thermal expansion of air is relatively small, so the correction is usually small as well. However, the correction becomes more significant at high temperatures and pressures. For example, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the correction is only about 0.6%. However, at a temperature of 100°C and a pressure of 10 atm, the correction is about 10%. 
  <br><br>
  Temperature and pressure have a significant effect on the velocity of sound in air. The velocity of sound in air increases with an increase in temperature and pressure. This is because an increase in temperature and pressure increases the density and stiffness of air, which makes it easier for sound waves to propagate through the medium. The velocity of sound in air is approximately 331 m/s at 0°C and 1 atm.</p>

The coefficient of thermal expansion of air is relatively small, so the correction is usually small as well. However, at high temperatures and pressures, the correction becomes significant.

The velocity of sound in air is affected by both temperature and pressure. As the temperature of the air increases, the velocity of sound increases as well. This is because the air molecules have more kinetic energy at higher temperatures, which allows sound waves to travel faster through the air. On the other hand, an increase in pressure causes an increase in the density of the air, which in turn increases the velocity of sound.

  <h2 class="qa-question">Deduce Newton's formula for velocity of sound in a gas. Why was the correction needed? What correction made by Laplace? [2070 Supp. Set A Q.No. 7a]</h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in a gas can be derived by considering the propagation of small pressure waves through the gas. The speed of sound is equal to the square root of the ratio of the elastic modulus of the gas to its density. For a gas with a constant specific heat, the speed of sound can be expressed as:
v = √(γP/ρ)

where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, P is the pressure, and ρ is the density.

Laplace's correction was needed because the above formula assumes that the gas is incompressible, which is not true in reality. As the pressure of the gas increases, its density also increases, which affects the velocity of sound. Laplace's correction takes into account the effect of the gas compressibility on the velocity of sound by introducing a correction term to the formula.</p>

The velocity of sound is affected by several factors, including the medium through which it travels, the temperature and pressure of the medium, and the frequency of the sound wave. In general, the velocity of sound increases with increasing temperature and pressure, and with decreasing density. The velocity of sound is also higher in solids and liquids than in gases. </p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write an expression for the speed of sound in an ideal gas. Discuss the effect of change in temperature on the speed of sound.<span class="right-text">[2068 Old Q.No. 5a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the following expression:
v = √(γRT/M)

where v is the velocity of sound, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature of the gas, M is the molar mass of the gas, and γ is the ratio of the specific heats of the gas.

As the temperature of the gas increases, the velocity of sound also increases due to an increase in the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. This causes an increase in the pressure and density of the gas, leading to an increase in the speed of sound. Conversely, a decrease in temperature causes a decrease in the velocity of sound. </p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in gases assumes that the gas is incompressible and does not take into account the compressibility of air. Laplace corrected this by introducing a correction factor that takes into account the adiabatic compression of the gas. This correction factor is called Laplace's correction. The corrected formula for the velocity of sound is given by:</p>
  <p class="formula">v = √(γP/ρ) * (1 + (γ-1)/2 * (P₀/P) * (T/T₀))</p>
  <p class="qa-answer">Where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, P is the pressure of the gas, ρ is the density of the gas, P₀ is the pressure of the gas at standard conditions, T is the temperature of the gas, and T₀ is the temperature of the gas at standard conditions.</p>

  <p class="qa-answer">Newton's formula for the velocity of sound in gases assumes that the particles of gas have zero size and that there are no forces of attraction or repulsion between them. However, in reality, the gas particles have a finite size and are subject to intermolecular forces, which affect the speed of sound. Laplace's correction to Newton's formula takes these factors into account and provides a more accurate estimate of the speed of sound in gases.</p>
  <p>To derive Laplace's corrected formula, we start with Newton's formula:</p>
  <p class="math">v = √(γRT/M)</p>
  <p>where v is the velocity of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molar mass of the gas.</p>
  <p>Laplace's correction involves replacing γ with γ'+(a^2/3V^2), where γ' is the adiabatic index, a is the size of the gas molecules, and V is the volume per molecule. Substituting this expression for γ in the formula for v, we get:</p>
  <p class="math">v = √[(γ'+a^2/3V^2)RT/M]</p>
  <p>This is Laplace's corrected formula for the velocity of sound in gases.</p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">What is the significance of Laplace's correction to Newton's formula for the velocity of sound? Also, explain how different factors affect the velocity of sound. <span class="right-text">[2069 Set B Q.No. 7b]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer"> Newton's formula for the velocity of sound assumes that the medium is incompressible and that there are no changes in pressure or temperature within the medium. However, this is not the case for most real-world situations. Laplace's correction to Newton's formula takes into account the compressibility of the medium and the changes in pressure and temperature that occur within it. 
The velocity of sound is affected by various factors such as:

The temperature of the medium: The velocity of sound increases with an increase in temperature.
The density of the medium: The velocity of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the density of the medium.
The elasticity of the medium: The velocity of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the elastic modulus of the medium.
The pressure of the medium: The velocity of sound increases with an increase in pressure.
Therefore, the significance of Laplace's correction lies in its ability to provide a more accurate calculation of the velocity of sound in real-world situations, where the medium is not incompressible and where there are changes in pressure and temperature within the medium. </p>

  <h2 class="qa-question">Write an expression for the speed of sound in an ideal gas. Discuss the effect of a change in temperature on the speed of sound. <span class="right-text">[2068 Old Q.No. 5a]</span></h2>
  <p class="qa-answer">The speed of sound in an ideal gas can be expressed as:
v = sqrt(γ * R * T)

where v is the speed of sound, γ is the ratio of specific heats (cp/cv) of the gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the gas.

The effect of a change in temperature on the speed of sound can be explained by the equation above. As the temperature of the gas increases, the speed of sound also increases. This is because an increase in temperature leads to an increase in the average speed of the gas particles, which in turn leads to an increase in the frequency of collisions between them. This increased frequency of collisions results in a higher propagation speed of sound waves through the gas. Conversely, a decrease in temperature leads to a decrease in the speed of sound in the gas.</p>
