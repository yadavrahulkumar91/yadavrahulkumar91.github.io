  <h1>Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The glenohumeral joint is a synovial multiaxial spheroidal joint between the roughly hemispherical head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula.</li>
    <li>It is the most mobile joint in the body and the most frequently dislocated.</li>
    <li>The anatomy of the glenohumeral joint is a compromise between the requirements for motion and stability.</li>
    <li>Motion and stability depend on the surrounding muscular and soft tissue envelope more than on the shape and surface area of the articulating surfaces.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Joint Structure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The humeral head is held to the concave glenoid fossa by the compressive action of the rotator cuff muscles.</li>
    <li>The stabilizing mechanism of the glenohumeral joint is one of concavity compression.</li>
    <li>The rotator cuff muscles are attached to the proximal humerus through a musculotendinous envelope.</li>
    <li>The deep surface of the musculotendinous envelope fuses with the lateral part of the articular fibrous capsule.</li>
    <li>The humeral head is contained in a spherical space bounded medially by the glenoid fossa and elsewhere by the deep surface of the fibrous capsule.</li>
    <li>The fibrous capsule acts as a form of osseofibrous acetabulum.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Anatomical Boundaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The walls of the spherical space containing the glenohumeral joint consist of:</li>
    <li>&rarr; Coracoid anteriorly</li>
    <li>&rarr; Coraco-acromial ligament anterosuperiorly</li>
    <li>&rarr; Acromion and spine of the scapula posteriorly, posterosuperiorly, and posterolaterally</li>
    <li>&rarr; Deep surface of deltoid anterolaterally and laterally</li>
    <li>This arrangement creates two gliding planes:</li>
    <li>&rarr; Internal gliding plane (glenohumeral articular gliding plane)</li>
    <li>&rarr; External gliding plane (subcoracoid-subacromial-subdeltoid plane)</li>
    <li>The external gliding plane is continuous with the plane under the scapula (scapulothoracic gliding plane).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Gliding and Restrictions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gliding in the glenohumeral joint is facilitated by the synovial lined cavities of the joint and the subcoracoid, subacromial, and subdeltoid bursae.</li>
    <li>Infection, inflammation, and injury can cause adhesions and fibrosis in these gliding planes.</li>
   

 <li>Adhesions and fibrosis lead to a restriction of motion specific to the site and extent of adhesion.</li>
    <li>The surfaces of the gliding planes are extensive, and fibrosis can be very restricting.</li>
  </ul>
