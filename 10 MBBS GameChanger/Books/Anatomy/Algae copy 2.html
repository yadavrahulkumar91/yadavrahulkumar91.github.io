                          <p>Isogamy is most primitive where genetic variation is very low and Oogamy is most advanced
                            due to high genetic variation.</p>

                              <p>1. Plant body is represented by an unbranched filament attached to the substratum with
                                the help of 'holdfast'</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>a. Holdfast is hyaline (colourless) as it lacks chlorophyll.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>2. Cell wall consists of two layers:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>a. Inner layer is made up of cellulose and</li>
                                <li>b. outer layer is mostly made up of protopectin which is insoluble in water.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>3. Filament is wetty due to protopectin.</p>

                              <p>4. Cell consists of single girdle shaped chloroplast with 1 or more pyrenoids.</p>

                              <p>5. Asexual reproduction by (Under favourable condition)</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>a. Ζoospores:
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>i. Zoospores of Ulothrix are quadriflagellate.</li>
                                    <li>ii. Quadriflagellate zoospores may be: microzoospore or macrozoospore.</li>
                                    <li>iii. Sometimes, it also produces biflagellate microzoospores.</li>
                                    <li>iv. All cells except holdfast are capable of producing zoospores.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                </li>

                              </ul>

                              <p>6. Sexual reproduction</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>a. Isogamous type. Ulothrix is heterothallic.</li>
                                <li>b. Fertilization takes place on water surface (external fertilization)</li>
                                <li>c. The gametes are motile and biflagellate.</li>
                                <li>d. When two gametes of (+) and (-) strain come together, they fuse and a
                                  quadriflagellate zygote formed.</li>
                                <li>e. When tetraflagellated zygote goes to bottom, it loses flagella and forms thick
                                  covering called a zygospore.</li>
                                <li>f. After undergoing a period of rest, the zygospore undergoes meiosis to produce
                                  haploid meiozoospore which under favourable conditions germinate to produce new
                                  filaments.</li>
                                <li>g. All spores germinate. Each spore germinates into 1 plant.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>7. Life cycle in Ulolthrix is haplontic.</p>
