      <h1>Genes and Human Diseases</h1>
      <p>Genes play a fundamental role in human health and disease. Mutations in genes can lead to various genetic disorders and contribute to the development of complex diseases. Understanding the relationship between genes and human diseases is crucial for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.</p>
      <h2>Mutations</h2>
      <p>Mutations are alterations in the DNA sequence of a gene that can result in changes in the structure or function of the encoded protein. Mutations can occur spontaneously or be inherited from parents. They can have different effects on gene function and can be classified into several categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Missense mutations: These mutations involve a change in a single DNA base pair, leading to the substitution of one amino acid in the protein sequence. Missense mutations can affect protein function, stability, or interactions.</li>
        <li>Nonsense mutations: Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in the DNA sequence, resulting in the production of a truncated protein that is usually nonfunctional.</li>
        <li>Frameshift mutations: Frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted from the DNA sequence, altering the reading frame. This leads to a shift in the subsequent amino acid sequence, often resulting in a nonfunctional protein.</li>
        <li>Splice site mutations: Splice site mutations affect the normal process of RNA splicing, leading to the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons in the mature mRNA. This can result in abnormal protein products.</li>
        <li>Repeat expansions: Repeat expansions involve the expansion of trinucleotide or other repetitive DNA sequences. These expansions can disrupt gene function and are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mutations can be responsible for monogenic disorders, which are caused by alterations in a single gene, as well as contribute to the development of complex diseases influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.</p>
      <h1>Mendelian Disorders</h1>

      <h2>Transmission Patterns of Single-Gene Disorders</h2>
      
      <p>Single-gene disorders, also known as Mendelian disorders, are caused by mutations in a single gene and follow distinct inheritance patterns. These patterns include:</p>
      
      <h3>Autosomal Dominant Disorders</h3>
      
      <p>In autosomal dominant disorders, a mutation in one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disease. The affected gene can be inherited from an affected parent or occur as a new mutation. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and developing the disorder.</p>
      
      <h3>Autosomal Recessive Disorders</h3>
      
      <p>Autosomal recessive disorders require the presence of two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to manifest the disease. Typically, both parents are carriers of the mutation and do not show symptoms. Each child of carrier parents has a 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene and developing the disorder.</p>
      
      <h3>X-Linked Disorders</h3>
      
      <p>X-linked disorders are caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. They predominantly affect males, as they have one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In X-linked recessive disorders, the mutation is on the X chromosome and can be inherited from an affected mother or occur as a new mutation. Carrier females have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their children, while affected males pass the mutation to all their daughters but not their sons.</p>
      
      <h2>Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Single-Gene (Mendelian) Disorders</h2>
      
      <p>Mendelian disorders result from various molecular and biochemical abnormalities, including:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Enzyme Defects and Their Consequences: Mutations in genes encoding enzymes can lead to deficiencies or impaired activity, disrupting metabolic pathways and causing disease.</li>
        <li>Defects in Receptors and Transport Systems: Mutations affecting receptors or transport proteins can disrupt signaling or nutrient uptake, leading to disorders.</li>
        <li>Alterations in Structure, Function, or Quantity of Nonenzyme Proteins: Mutations in genes encoding structural or regulatory proteins can affect their normal function or abundance, contributing to disease development.</li>
        <li>Genetically Determined Adverse Reactions to Drugs: Genetic variations can influence an individual's response to certain medications, resulting in adverse reactions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Disorders Associated with Defects in Structural Proteins</h2>
      
      <p>Disorders linked to defects in structural proteins involve abnormalities in proteins responsible for maintaining the integrity and structure of tissues. Examples of such disorders include:</p>
      
      <h3>Marfan Syndrome</h3>
      
      <p>Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, leading to abnormal connective tissue. Pathogenesis involves structural weaknesses in various organs, including the heart, blood vessels, bones, and eyes. Clinical features can include skeletal abnormalities, cardiovascular complications, and ocular manifestations.</p>
      
      <h3>Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS)</h3>
      
      <p>Ehlers-Danlos syndromes encompass a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in collagen synthesis or structure. Various subtypes exist, each with distinct clinical features. EDS can affect the skin, joints, blood vessels, and other tissues, leading to hyperelasticity, joint hypermobility, and fragile blood vessels.</p>
      
      <h2>Disorders Associated with Defects in Receptor Proteins</h2>
      
      <p>Disorders associated with defects in receptor proteins involve mutations in genes encoding receptors involved in cellular signaling and
      
       communication. One example is:</p>
      
      <h3>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h3>
      
      <p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene, impairing the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from the bloodstream. This leads to elevated LDL levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
      
      <h2>Disorders Associated with Defects in Enzymes</h2>
      
      <p>Disorders associated with defects in enzymes involve mutations in genes encoding enzymes responsible for various metabolic processes. Some examples include:</p>
      
      <h3>Lysosomal Storage Diseases</h3>
      
      <p>Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes. These deficiencies lead to the accumulation of substrates within cells, resulting in cellular dysfunction. Examples of lysosomal storage diseases include Tay-Sachs disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Gaucher disease, and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).</p>
      
      <h2>Disorders Associated with Defects in Proteins That Regulate Cell Growth</h2>
      
      <p>Disorders associated with defects in proteins involved in regulating cell growth can result in abnormal cell proliferation and contribute to the development of certain diseases, including cancer.</p>
      
      <p>Understanding the molecular basis and inheritance patterns of Mendelian disorders is essential for accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and the development of targeted therapies.</p>


      
<h1>Complex Multigenic Disorders</h1>
<p>Complex multigenic disorders are a group of diseases influenced by multiple genetic factors as well as environmental and lifestyle factors. Unlike Mendelian disorders, which are caused by mutations in a single gene, complex disorders involve the interplay of multiple genes and environmental influences. These disorders often exhibit a multifactorial inheritance pattern, meaning that the risk of developing the disease is influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental factors.</p>
<h2>Causes and Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The exact causes and mechanisms of complex multigenic disorders are often complex and not fully understood. However, several factors contribute to their development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Genetic Variations: Multiple genes across the genome may contribute to the disease susceptibility. These variations can include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs).</li>
  <li>Gene-Gene Interactions: Interactions between different genes can influence disease risk. Certain combinations of genetic variations may result in a higher or lower susceptibility to the disorder.</li>
  <li>Gene-Environment Interactions: Environmental factors, such as diet, lifestyle choices, exposure to toxins, and infectious agents, can interact with genetic factors to increase or decrease the risk of developing the disease.</li>
  <li>Epigenetic Modifications: Epigenetic changes, which modify gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence, can also play a role in complex disorders. These modifications can be influenced by environmental factors and affect gene activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of Complex Multigenic Disorders</h2>
<p>Complex multigenic disorders encompass a wide range of diseases across various medical fields. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cardiovascular Diseases: Conditions like coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure have complex genetic and environmental factors contributing to their development.</li>
  <li>Diabetes Mellitus: Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have genetic susceptibility, but their onset is influenced by lifestyle factors, diet, and obesity.</li>
  <li>Autoimmune Disorders: Diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus involve complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors that trigger an abnormal immune response.</li>
  <li>Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders have a complex etiology involving genetic predisposition, neurodevelopmental factors, and environmental influences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Diagnosis and Management</h2>
<p>The diagnosis and management of complex multigenic disorders present significant challenges due to their multifactorial nature. It requires a comprehensive approach that combines genetic testing, family history evaluation, and consideration of environmental and lifestyle factors. Genetic counseling plays a crucial role in helping individuals understand their risk factors and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Treatment strategies for complex disorders often involve a combination of interventions targeting both genetic and environmental factors. These may include lifestyle modifications, medication, therapy, and preventive measures to reduce the impact of modifiable risk factors.</p>










<h1>Chromosomal Disorders</h1>
<p>Chromosomal disorders are a group of genetic disorders caused by abnormalities in the structure or number of chromosomes. These abnormalities can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations and can be categorized into several subtypes.</p>

<p>In addition to trisomy 21, trisomies involving other autosomes can occur, although they are less common. Examples include trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), both of which are associated with severe developmental abnormalities and reduced life expectancy.</p>
<h3>Chromosome 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</h3>
<p>Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome, is caused by a small deletion on chromosome 22. It can result in a range of physical and developmental abnormalities, including cardiac defects, immune system deficiencies, and characteristic facial features.</p>
<h2>Cytogenetic Disorders Involving Sex Chromosomes</h2>
<p>Cytogenetic disorders involving sex chromosomes are characterized by abnormalities in the X and Y chromosomes. These disorders can affect sexual development and have various clinical manifestations.</p>
<h3>Klinefelter Syndrome</h3>
<p>Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in males characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome (XXY). It leads to hypogonadism, infertility, and physical features such as tall stature and reduced facial and body hair.</p>
<h3>Turner Syndrome</h3>
<p>Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in females caused by the absence of one X chromosome (X0). It results in short stature, ovarian dysfunction, and various physical features, such as a webbed neck and heart abnormalities.</p>
<h3>Hermaphroditism and Pseudohermaphroditism</h3>
<p>Hermaphroditism and pseudohermaphroditism refer to conditions where there is ambiguity or discrepancy between the individual's chromosomal sex and their external genitalia. These conditions can arise due to various chromosomal abnormalities affecting sexual development.</p>
<p>Understanding and diagnosing chromosomal disorders often involve techniques such as karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosomal microarray analysis. Genetic counseling and management strategies play an essential role in supporting individuals and families affected by these disorders.</p>
















<h1>Single-Gene Disorders with Nonclassic Inheritance</h1>
<p>Single-gene disorders with nonclassic inheritance patterns are a group of genetic disorders that do not follow the typical Mendelian patterns of inheritance. These disorders result from specific genetic mutations or mechanisms that deviate from the classical autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked inheritance patterns.</p>
<h2>Diseases Caused by Trinucleotide-Repeat Mutations</h2>
<p>Trinucleotide-repeat mutations are genetic mutations characterized by the expansion of a repetitive sequence of three nucleotides in a particular gene. The abnormal expansion of these repeats can lead to various disorders with distinctive clinical features.</p>

<h1>The Normal Immune Response</h1>
<h2>12.6.2 The Normal Immune Response</h2>
<h3>12.6.2.1 Innate Immunity</h3>
<h4>Components of Innate Immunity</h4>
<p>Innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens and is present from birth. It includes physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as cellular and molecular components that provide rapid but nonspecific immune responses. These components include phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages), natural killer (NK) cells, complement proteins, and antimicrobial peptides.</p>
<h4>Cellular Receptors for Microbes, Products of Damaged Cells, and Foreign Substances</h4>
<p>Cellular receptors play a crucial role in recognizing and initiating immune responses against pathogens and foreign substances. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a group of receptors expressed on immune cells that recognize specific molecular patterns associated with microbial pathogens. NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the inflammasome are other receptor systems involved in detecting microbial products and initiating inflammatory responses.</p>
<h5>Toll-Like Receptors</h5>
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by various microorganisms. Upon recognition, TLRs activate signaling pathways that trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial molecules.</p>
<h5>NOD-Like Receptors and the Inflammasome</h5>
<p>NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are cytoplasmic receptors that detect microbial products and cellular stress signals. Upon activation, NLRs can form complexes called inflammasomes, which activate caspase enzymes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of cell death.</p>
<h5>Other Receptors for Microbial Products</h5>
<p>Apart from TLRs and NLRs, other receptors, such as C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and scavenger receptors, are involved in recognizing specific microbial components. These receptors contribute to the activation of innate immune responses and the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune responses.</p>
<h4>Reactions of Innate Immunity</h4>
<p>Innate immunity reactions include inflammation, phagocytosis, and the release of antimicrobial substances. Inflammation is a protective response triggered by tissue injury or infection. It involves the recruitment of immune cells, increased vascular permeability, and the release of inflammatory mediators to eliminate pathogens and initiate tissue repair.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.2 Adaptive Immunity</h3>
<p>Adaptive immunity, also known as acquired immunity, is a specialized defense mechanism that provides specific and long-lasting protection against pathogens. It involves the activation of lymphocytes (T and B cells) and the production of antigen-specific responses.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.3 Cells of the Immune System</h3>
<h4>Lymphocyte Diversity</h4>
<p>Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in adaptive immunity. They exhibit high diversity, allowing them to recognize a wide range of antigens. Lymphocyte diversity is achieved through gene rearrangements and somatic hypermutation, resulting in the production of a vast repertoire of antigen receptors.</p>
<h4>T Lymphocytes</h4>
<p>T lymphocytes, or T cells, are a subset of lymphocytes that play a crucial role in cell-mediated immune responses. They recognize antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and can differentiate into effector T cells (e.g., cytotoxic T cells) or regulatory T cells, depending on the context.</p>
<h4>B Lymphocytes</h4>
<p>B lymphocytes, or B cells, are another subset of lymphocytes involved in adaptive immune responses. They produce antibodies (immunoglobulins) that can bind to specific antigens. B cells can differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete antibodies, or memory B cells, which provide long-term immunity.</p>
<h4>Dendritic Cells</h4>
<p>Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells that capture, process, and present antigens to T cells. They play a crucial role in initiating adaptive immune responses by activating naive T cells and promoting the differentiation of effector T cells.</p>
<h4>Macrophages</h4>
<p>Macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf and destroy pathogens. They also play a role in antigen presentation and the activation of T cells. Macrophages are versatile immune cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses.</p>
<h4>Natural Killer Cells</h4>
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of lymphocyte that participates in the innate immune response. They can recognize and kill infected or abnormal cells, including tumor cells, without prior sensitization.</p>
<h4>Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)</h4>
<p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of immune cells that resemble lymphocytes but lack antigen-specific receptors. They contribute to innate immune responses, tissue homeostasis, and immune regulation by producing various cytokines.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.4 Tissues of the Immune System</h3>
<h4>Generative Lymphoid Organs</h4>
<p>Generative lymphoid organs, including the bone marrow and thymus, are responsible for the development and maturation of lymphocytes. The bone marrow is the site of B cell development, while the thymus is where T cells mature and acquire their antigen receptor repertoire.</p>
<h4>Peripheral Lymphoid Organs</h4>
<p>Peripheral lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, spleen, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), serve as sites for immune cell activation and interaction. They facilitate the encounter between antigens and lymphocytes, leading to the initiation of immune responses.</p>
<h4>Lymphocyte Recirculation</h4>
<p>Lymphocytes continually recirculate between the blood, lymphatic system, and lymphoid organs. This allows them to surveil different tissues and respond to pathogens efficiently. Lymphocyte recirculation is essential for immune surveillance and immune cell activation in response to antigen exposure.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.5 Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Molecules: The Peptide Display System of Adaptive Immunity</h3>
<p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are cell surface proteins that present antigen peptides to T cells. They are essential for antigen recognition and activation of T cell responses. MHC molecules are divided into two classes: MHC class I, which presents antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and MHC class II, which presents antigens to CD4+ helper T cells.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.6 Cytokines: Messenger Molecules of the Immune System</h3>
<p>Cytokines are small signaling proteins produced by various immune cells. They play a critical role in cell communication and orchestrate immune responses. Cytokines regulate immune cell development, activation, migration, and effector functions. They can have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the context.</p>
<h3>12.6.2.7 Overview of Lymphocyte Activation and Immune Responses</h3>
<h4>Display and Recognition of Antigens</h4>
<p>Antigens are substances that can induce an immune response. They are recognized by lymphocytes through their specific antigen receptors. Antigen presentation is the process by which antigens are displayed to T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells.</p>
<h4>Cell-Mediated Immunity: Activation of T Lymphocytes and Elimination of Intracellular Microbes</h4>
<p>Cell-mediated immunity involves the activation of T lymphocytes, primarily CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which can directly kill infected cells. These T cells recognize antigens presented on MHC class I molecules and eliminate intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and intracellular bacteria.</p>
<h4>Humoral Immunity: Activation of B Lymphocytes and Elimination of Extracellular Microbes</h4>
<p>Humoral immunity is mediated by B lymphocytes and antibodies. B cells are activated upon recognition of antigens, leading to their differentiation into plasma cells that secrete antibodies. Antibodies can neutralize or eliminate extracellular pathogens, preventing their invasion and spread.</p>
<h4>Decline of Immune Responses and Immunologic Memory</h4>
<p>After an immune response, the immune system undergoes a process of contraction and resolution. Once the pathogen is cleared, the immune response diminishes. However, memory T and B cells are generated during the primary immune response and provide long-term immunity upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.</p>
<h3>12.6.3 Hypersensitivity: Immunologically Mediated Tissue Injury</h3>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions are abnormal immune responses that can cause tissue damage. They are classified into four types: type I (immediate or IgE-mediated), type II (antibody-dependent cytotoxicity), type III (immune complex-mediated), and type IV (delayed-type or cell-mediated). These hypersensitivity reactions can result in a wide range of conditions, from allergies to autoimmune diseases.</p>












<h1>Hypersensitivity: Immunologically Mediated Tissue Injury</h1>
<h2>Classification of Hypersensitivity Diseases</h2>
<p>Hypersensitivity diseases are classified into four types based on the immune mechanisms involved. These types are Type I (immediate hypersensitivity), Type II (antibody-mediated hypersensitivity), Type III (immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity), and Type IV (T cell-mediated hypersensitivity).</p>
<h2>Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity</h2>
<p>Immediate hypersensitivity, also known as Type I hypersensitivity, is characterized by an immediate immune response upon exposure to an allergen. It involves the activation of TH2 cells and the production of IgE antibodies.</p>
<h3>Activation of TH2 Cells and Production of IgE Antibody</h3>
<p>Upon exposure to an allergen, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present the allergen to CD4+ T cells. In the case of Type I hypersensitivity, TH2 cells are activated, leading to the production of cytokines that stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies specific to the allergen.</p>
<h3>Sensitization and Activation of Mast Cells</h3>
<p>The IgE antibodies produced during sensitization bind to high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils. This sensitization primes these cells for future encounters with the allergen.</p>
<h3>Mediators of Immediate Hypersensitivity</h3>
<p>Upon re-exposure to the allergen, cross-linking of IgE molecules on sensitized mast cells triggers the release of various mediators that contribute to the allergic response.</p>
<h4>Preformed Mediators</h4>
<p>Preformed mediators, such as histamine and proteases, are stored in granules within mast cells. Their release leads to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and itching.</p>
<h4>Lipid Mediators</h4>
<p>Lipid mediators, including leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are synthesized upon mast cell activation. They contribute to bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and inflammation.</p>
<h4>Cytokines</h4>
<p>Mast cells also produce cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which amplify the allergic response and recruit other immune cells to the site of inflammation.</p>
<h3>Late-Phase Reaction</h3>
<p>In addition to the immediate response, some individuals may experience a late-phase reaction several hours after exposure to the allergen. This reaction involves the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of additional mediators, leading to prolonged inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
<h3>Development of Allergies</h3>
<p>The development of allergies involves a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Genetic factors influence the immune response and the production of IgE antibodies, while environmental factors contribute to allergen exposure and sensitization.</p>
<h3>Systemic Anaphylaxis</h3>
<p>Systemic anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rapidly and affects multiple organ systems. It is characterized by widespread mast cell activation and the release of mediators throughout the body. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives, and gastrointestinal distress.</p>
<h3>Local Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3>
<p>In addition to systemic reactions, immediate hypersensitivity can manifest as local reactions in specific tissues. Examples include allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and allergic conjunctivitis.</p>
<h2>Antibody-Mediated (Type II) Hypersensitivity</h2>
<p>Antibody-mediated hypersensitivity, or Type II hypersensitivity, involves the binding of antibodies to antigens on cell surfaces or in tissues. This interaction leads to various immune responses, including opsonization and phagocytosis, inflammation, and cellular dysfunction.</p>
<h3>Opsonization and Phagocytosis</h3>
<p>Antibodies, particularly IgG and IgM, can bind to antigens on target cells or tissues, marking them for destruction by phagocytes. This process, known as opsonization, enhances phagocytosis and subsequent clearance of the targeted cells.</p>
<h3>Inflammation</h3>
<p>The binding of antibodies to antigens can activate the complement system, leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators. This results in tissue damage and inflammation at the site of antibody-antigen interaction.</p>
<h3>Cellular Dysfunction</h3>
<p>In some cases, the binding of antibodies to cell surface antigens can interfere with normal cell function. This can lead to cellular dysfunction and subsequent tissue damage.</p>
<h2>Immune Complex–Mediated (Type III) Hypersensitivity</h2>
<p>Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity, or Type III hypersensitivity, involves the formation and deposition of immune complexes in various tissues. The immune complexes trigger an inflammatory response that can result in tissue damage.</p>
<h3>Systemic Immune Complex Disease</h3>
<p>Systemic immune complex diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), involve the widespread formation and deposition of immune complexes throughout the body. This leads to inflammation and damage in multiple organs.</p>
<h3>Local Immune Complex Disease (Arthus Reaction)</h3>
<p>Local immune complex diseases, also known as Arthus reactions, occur at sites of antigen-antibody complex deposition. These reactions are often seen in response to localized exposure to antigens, such as inhaled allergens or bacterial antigens.</p>
<h2>T Cell–Mediated (Type IV) Hypersensitivity</h2>
<p>T cell-mediated hypersensitivity, or Type IV hypersensitivity, involves the activation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in response to antigens. This activation leads to the recruitment of immune cells and the release of cytokines, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
<h3>CD4+ T Cell–Mediated Inflammation</h3>
<p>CD4+ T cells play a central role in Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Upon recognition of antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector T cells and release cytokines that contribute to inflammation.</p>
<h4>Activation of CD4+ T Cells</h4>
<p>Activation of CD4+ T cells requires antigen presentation by APCs and the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) with antigenic peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Co-stimulatory signals provided by APCs are also required for full T cell activation.</p>
<h4>Responses of Differentiated Effector T Cells</h4>
<p>Differentiated effector T cells can further differentiate into distinct subsets, such as TH1, TH2, TH17, or regulatory T cells, depending on the cytokine milieu. These subsets have different functions and play roles in various T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions.</p>
<h4>Clinical Examples of CD4+ T Cell–Mediated Inflammatory Reactions</h4>
<p>Examples of CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions include contact dermatitis, tuberculin-type delayed hypersensitivity reactions, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes.</p>
<h3>CD8+ T Cell–Mediated Cytotoxicity</h3>
<p>CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, can recognize and directly kill target cells that display antigens on their surface. This cell-mediated cytotoxicity is important in the immune response against intracellular pathogens, tumor cells, and transplanted tissues.</p>













<h2>Autoimmune Diseases</h2>
<p>Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune responses against self-antigens, leading to tissue damage and inflammation. They can affect various organs and tissues in the body.</p>
<h3>Immunologic Tolerance</h3>
<p>Immunologic tolerance refers to the ability of the immune system to recognize and tolerate self-antigens while mounting an immune response against foreign antigens. Tolerance mechanisms can be divided into central tolerance and peripheral tolerance.</p>
<h4>Central Tolerance</h4>
<p>Central tolerance occurs in the thymus and bone marrow, where developing T cells and B cells undergo selection processes to eliminate or inactivate those that react strongly against self-antigens.</p>
<h4>Peripheral Tolerance</h4>
<p>Peripheral tolerance mechanisms function outside the thymus and bone marrow to prevent the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes. These mechanisms include suppression by regulatory T cells, clonal deletion, anergy, and immune privilege of certain tissues.</p>
<h3>Mechanisms of Autoimmunity: General Principles</h3>
<p>The development of autoimmunity involves a complex interplay of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors.</p>
<h4>Role of Susceptibility Genes</h4>
<p>Susceptibility genes, particularly those within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, have been strongly associated with autoimmune diseases. Certain HLA alleles are linked to increased risk, as they may present self-antigens in a way that triggers an immune response.</p>
<h5>Association of HLA Alleles with Disease</h5>
<p>Specific HLA alleles have been found to be associated with various autoimmune diseases, such as HLA-DRB1 with rheumatoid arthritis and HLA-B27 with ankylosing spondylitis.</p>
<h5>Association of Non-MHC Genes with Autoimmune Diseases</h5>
<p>In addition to MHC genes, non-MHC genes also play a role in the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. These genes may regulate immune responses, influence immune cell functions, or contribute to the maintenance of immunologic tolerance.</p>
<h4>Role of Infections</h4>
<p>Infections can trigger or exacerbate autoimmune diseases through several mechanisms. Molecular mimicry, where microbial antigens resemble self-antigens, can lead to cross-reactive immune responses. Infections can also induce bystander activation or cause nonspecific activation of the immune system, leading to autoimmune reactions.</p>
<h3>General Features of Autoimmune Diseases</h3>
<p>Autoimmune diseases share some common features, including chronicity, tissue damage caused by immune responses, the presence of autoantibodies, and inflammation.</p>
<h3>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</h3>
<p>SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, immune complex formation, and multi-system involvement.</p>
<h4>Spectrum of Autoantibodies in SLE</h4>
<p>Patients with SLE can develop a wide range of autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies, and others.</p>
<h5>Other Autoantibodies</h5>
<p>Other autoantibodies commonly seen in SLE include anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies (APLAs), and anti-ribosomal P antibodies.</p>
<h4>Etiology and Pathogenesis of SLE</h4>
<p>The exact cause of SLE is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors.</p>
<h5>Genetic Factors</h5>
<p>Multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of SLE, including genes involved in immune regulation, apoptosis, and complement system components.</p>
<h5>Immunologic Factors</h5>
<p>Immunologic abnormalities in SLE include the breakdown of immunologic tolerance, activation of autoreactive B cells and T cells, and the production of autoantibodies and immune complexes.</p>
<h5>Environmental Factors</h5>
<p>Environmental factors, such as sunlight exposure, certain medications, hormones, and infections, can trigger or exacerbate SLE in susceptible individuals.</p>
<h5>A Model for the Pathogenesis of SLE</h5>
<p>The "dual-hit" model proposes that genetic predisposition and environmental triggers contribute to the development of SLE. The initial hit leads to immune dysregulation, and subsequent hits, such as infections or hormonal changes, further disrupt immune tolerance and promote autoimmunity.</p>
<h5>Mechanism of Tissue Injury</h5>
<p>Tissue injury in SLE is primarily mediated by immune complexes, which deposit in various organs and activate complement, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
<h5>Clinical Features</h5>
<p>SLE can affect multiple organs and present with diverse clinical manifestations, including rash, arthritis, serositis, renal involvement, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>
<h5>Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus</h5>
<p>Chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a localized form of lupus that primarily affects the skin, causing scaly, discoid-shaped lesions with potential scarring.</p>
<h5>Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus</h5>
<p>Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) is characterized by photosensitive, annular, or psoriasiform skin lesions that typically spare the central face.</p>
<h4>Drug-Induced Lupus Erythematosus</h4>
<p>Some medications, such as certain antihypertensive drugs and anticonvulsants, can induce a lupus-like syndrome that resolves upon discontinuation of the offending drug.</p>
<h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints, leading to joint inflammation, pain, swelling, and eventual joint destruction.</p>
<h3>Sjögren Syndrome</h3>
<p>Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, resulting in dryness of the eyes and mouth.</p>
<h4>Etiology and Pathogenesis</h4>
<p>The exact cause of Sjögren syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.</p>
<h4>Clinical Features</h4>
<p>Common clinical features of Sjögren syndrome include dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia), along with systemic manifestations such as fatigue, joint pain, and parotid gland enlargement.</p>
<h3>Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)</h3>
<p>Systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrosis, vascular abnormalities, and immune dysfunction.</p>
<h4>Etiology and Pathogenesis</h4>
<p>The exact cause of systemic sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to involve genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, and vascular abnormalities.</p>
<h4>Clinical Features</h4>
<p>Clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis can vary widely and may involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. Common features include thickening and hardening of the skin, Raynaud phenomenon, and internal organ involvement.</p>
<h3>Inflammatory Myopathies</h3>
<p>Inflammatory myopathies encompass a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by muscle inflammation and weakness.</p>
<h3>Mixed Connective Tissue Disease</h3>
<p>Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a distinct autoimmune disease that shares features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis.</p>
<h3>Polyarteritis Nodosa and Other Vasculitides</h3>
<p>Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis involving medium-sized arteries, while other vasculitides, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), involve small vessels.</p>
<h3>IgG4-Related Disease</h3>
<p>IgG4-related disease is a fibroinflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs, characterized by IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis.</p>








<h3>Rejection of Tissue Transplants</h3>
<p>Rejection of tissue transplants refers to the immune response mounted by the recipient's immune system against the transplanted tissue or organ. This immune response can lead to graft failure if not properly managed.</p>
<h4>Mechanisms of Recognition and Rejection of Allografts</h4>
<p>The recognition and rejection of allografts involve complex interactions between the recipient's immune system and the alloantigens present on the transplanted tissue.</p>
<h5>Recognition of Graft Alloantigens by T and B Lymphocytes</h5>
<p>T and B lymphocytes play a central role in recognizing and responding to the alloantigens expressed by the transplanted tissue. T cells recognize alloantigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on donor cells, while B cells produce alloantibodies against donor-specific antigens.</p>
<h5>T Cell–Mediated Reactions</h5>
<p>T cell-mediated rejection involves the activation of recipient T cells against the alloantigens expressed by the graft. This activation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines, causing tissue damage.</p>
<h5>Antibody-Mediated Reactions</h5>
<p>Antibody-mediated rejection occurs when preformed or de novo antibodies recognize and bind to donor-specific antigens on the transplanted tissue. This triggers complement activation and inflammation, resulting in tissue injury.</p>
<h4>Rejection of Kidney Grafts</h4>
<p>Kidney grafts are susceptible to both T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated rejection. Acute rejection typically occurs within the first few months after transplantation, while chronic rejection can develop over a longer period.</p>
<h4>Methods of Increasing Graft Survival</h4>
<p>Various strategies are employed to increase graft survival and minimize rejection, including the use of immunosuppressive medications, matching donor and recipient characteristics, and monitoring for signs of rejection.</p>
<h4>Transplantation of Other Solid Organs</h4>
<p>Transplantation of other solid organs, such as the heart, liver, lungs, and pancreas, also faces the risk of rejection. The mechanisms and management strategies for these transplants are similar to kidney transplantation.</p>
<h4>Transplantation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells</h4>
<p>Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), commonly known as bone marrow transplantation, is used to treat various hematologic disorders. HSC transplantation carries the risk of graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, which occurs when donor immune cells attack the recipient's tissues.</p>

<h1>Immunodeficiency Syndromes</h1>
<h2>Primary Immunodeficiencies</h2>
<p>Primary immunodeficiencies are a group of disorders characterized by defects in the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. These disorders are typically caused by genetic mutations that affect different components of the immune system, including innate and adaptive immunity.</p>
<h3>Defects in Innate Immunity</h3>
<p>Defects in innate immunity result in impaired function of cells and molecules involved in the initial defense against pathogens. This includes defects in leukocyte function, such as phagocytosis and chemotaxis, as well as deficiencies affecting the complement system, which plays a crucial role in the immune response.</p>
<h4>Defects in Leukocyte Function</h4>
<p>Defects in leukocyte function, such as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), lead to impaired microbial killing and decreased ability of immune cells to migrate to sites of infection.</p>
<h4>Deficiencies Affecting the Complement System</h4>
<p>Deficiencies affecting the complement system, such as hereditary angioedema (HAE) and complement component deficiencies, result in an inability to mount an effective complement-mediated immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.</p>
<h3>Defects in Adaptive Immunity</h3>
<p>Defects in adaptive immunity involve abnormalities in lymphocyte development, function, or both. These disorders can affect B cells, T cells, or both and result in impaired antibody production or cell-mediated immune responses.</p>
<h4>Defects in Lymphocyte Maturation</h4>
<p>Defects in lymphocyte maturation, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton agammaglobulinemia), and DiGeorge syndrome (thymic hypoplasia), lead to deficiencies in T and/or B cell development, impairing the immune response against pathogens.</p>
<h5>Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)</h5>
<p>SCID is a group of disorders characterized by defects in both T and B cell development, resulting in a severe immunodeficiency. This condition is often fatal in early childhood if not diagnosed and treated promptly.</p>
<h5>X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia (Bruton Agammaglobulinemia)</h5>
<p>X-linked agammaglobulinemia is a disorder primarily affecting males, characterized by the absence of mature B cells and low levels of immunoglobulins. This leads to recurrent bacterial infections and a lack of protective antibodies.</p>
<h5>DiGeorge Syndrome (Thymic Hypoplasia)</h5>
<p>DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a developmental defect in the thymus and parathyroid glands, resulting in T cell deficiency and hypoparathyroidism. Individuals with DiGeorge syndrome are prone to severe infections and may have other associated abnormalities.</p>
<h4>Defects in Lymphocyte Activation and Function</h4>
<p>Defects in lymphocyte activation and function involve abnormalities in signaling pathways or molecules required for proper immune cell activation and response. These disorders include hyper-IgM syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, isolated IgA deficiency, and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome.</p>
<h3>Immunodeficiencies Associated with Systemic Diseases</h3>
<p>Some immunodeficiencies are associated with systemic diseases that affect multiple organ systems. Examples include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and Ataxia telangiectasia, which involve both immune system dysfunction and additional clinical features.</p>
<h4>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</h4>
<p>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immune deficiency. Patients with this syndrome are prone to recurrent infections and are at an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders and lymphomas.</p>
<h4>Ataxia Telangiectasia</h4>
<p>Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, cerebellar dysfunction, telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels), and immune deficiency. It is caused by mutations in the ATM gene, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased susceptibility to infections and malignancies.</p>
<h2>Secondary Immunodeficiencies</h2>
<p>Secondary immunodeficiencies are acquired disorders that result from various causes, including infections, medications, malnutrition, and underlying systemic diseases. These conditions can lead to a temporary or permanent impairment of the immune system and an increased susceptibility to infections.</p>
<h2>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</h2>
<h3>Epidemiology</h3>
<p>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a severe immunodeficiency caused by infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV/AIDS has become a global pandemic, with millions of people affected worldwide.</p>
<h3>Etiology: The Properties of HIV</h3>
<h4>Structure of HIV</h4>
<p>HIV is a retrovirus composed of genetic material in the form of RNA and various proteins. The viral genome contains genes encoding for essential enzymes, structural proteins, and regulatory proteins necessary for viral replication and infection.</p>
<h3>Pathogenesis of HIV Infection and AIDS</h3>
<p>HIV infects and gradually depletes CD4+ T cells, leading to progressive immunosuppression. The pathogenesis of HIV infection involves multiple stages, including viral entry, infection of cells, viral replication, and T-cell depletion.</p>
<h4>Life Cycle of HIV</h4>
<p>The life cycle of HIV involves several steps, including viral entry, reverse transcription, integration into the host genome, transcription, translation, assembly, and release of new viral particles.</p>
<h4>Infection of Cells by HIV</h4>
<p>HIV primarily infects CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The virus enters these cells through interactions between viral surface proteins and cellular receptors, allowing it to gain entry and establish infection.</p>
<h4>Viral Replication</h4>
<p>Once inside host cells, HIV replicates its genetic material, produces viral proteins, assembles new viral particles, and releases them to infect other cells. The replication process is complex and involves the activity of viral enzymes and host cellular machinery.</p>
<h3>Mechanism of T-Cell Depletion in HIV Infection</h3>
<p>HIV infection leads to progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells through various mechanisms, including direct viral killing of infected cells, immune response-mediated destruction, and apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p>
<h3>HIV Infection of Non–T Cells</h3>
<h4>B Cell Function in HIV Infection</h4>
<p>HIV can also directly infect B cells, leading to impaired antibody production and dysregulation of the immune response. This contributes to the development of opportunistic infections and the progression of AIDS.</p>
<h3>Pathogenesis of Central Nervous System Involvement</h3>
<p>HIV can invade the central nervous system (CNS), leading to neurologic complications and cognitive impairment. The exact mechanisms of CNS involvement in HIV infection are not fully understood but may involve both direct viral effects and immune-mediated processes.</p>
<h3>Natural History of HIV Infection</h3>
<p>The natural history of HIV infection is characterized by different stages, including the primary infection, the phase of clinical latency, and the development of AIDS.</p>
<h4>Primary Infection, Virus Dissemination, and the Acute Retroviral Syndrome</h4>
<p>During the primary infection, the virus rapidly replicates and disseminates throughout the body. This initial stage is often accompanied by nonspecific symptoms known as the acute retroviral syndrome, which may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and flu-like symptoms.</p>
<h4>Chronic Infection: Phase of Clinical Latency</h4>
<p>After the acute phase, the virus enters a phase of clinical latency, during which the viral replication is suppressed, and the individual may be asymptomatic. However, HIV continues to replicate at low levels, causing slow and gradual damage to the immune system.</p>
<h4>AIDS</h4>
<p>AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection characterized by severe immunosuppression and the development of opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other AIDS-defining conditions. The presence of specific opportunistic infections or a decline in CD4+ T cell count below a certain threshold defines the diagnosis of AIDS.</p>
<h3>Clinical Features of AIDS</h3>
<p>AIDS is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including opportunistic infections, tumors, central nervous system disease, and other complications.</p>
<h4>Opportunistic Infections</h4>
<p>Opportunistic infections are infections caused by organisms that normally do not cause disease in individuals with a healthy immune system but can cause severe infections in individuals with AIDS. Examples include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and cytomegalovirus infection.</p>
<h4>Tumors</h4>
<p>Individuals with AIDS have an increased risk of developing certain malignancies, including Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. These tumors are often related to co-infections with oncogenic viruses, such as human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi sarcoma) and Epstein-Barr virus (lymphomas).</p>
<h4>Central Nervous System Disease</h4>
<p>HIV can cause various neurological complications, including cognitive impairment, encephalopathy, and opportunistic infections in the central nervous system. These manifestations contribute to significant morbidity and can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with AIDS.</p>
<h4>Effect of Antiretroviral Drug Therapy on the Clinical Course of HIV Infection</h4>
<p>Antiretroviral drug therapy, which includes the use of combinations of potent antiviral medications, has revolutionized the management of HIV infection. Effective treatment can suppress viral replication, restore immune function, and significantly prolong the lifespan of individuals with HIV/AIDS.</p>







<h1>12.6.7 Amyloidosis</h1>
<p>Amyloidosis refers to a group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of abnormal protein fibrils, known as amyloid, in various tissues and organs throughout the body. The accumulation of amyloid can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.</p>
<h2>12.6.7.1 Properties of Amyloid Proteins</h2>
<h3>Physical Nature of Amyloid</h3>
<p>Amyloid proteins have a characteristic beta-sheet secondary structure, which allows them to form insoluble fibrils. These fibrils have a cross-beta conformation, in which the beta-strands run perpendicular to the fibril axis, creating a highly stable structure.</p>
<h3>Chemical Nature of Amyloid</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibrils are composed of misfolded proteins that have undergone conformational changes, resulting in their aggregation and deposition as insoluble complexes. The specific protein involved can vary, with different types of amyloidosis associated with distinct precursor proteins.</p>
<h2>12.6.7.2 Pathogenesis and Classification of Amyloidosis</h2>
<h3>Primary Amyloidosis: Plasma Cell Disorders Associated with Amyloidosis</h3>
<p>Primary amyloidosis, also known as AL amyloidosis, is associated with the deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from immunoglobulin light chains produced by clonal plasma cells. These light chains are usually derived from an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, such as multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).</p>
<h3>Reactive Systemic Amyloidosis</h3>
<p>Reactive systemic amyloidosis, also known as AA amyloidosis, is caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. SAA is an acute-phase reactant that is produced in response to chronic inflammation, such as in rheumatoid arthritis or chronic infections. The deposition of SAA-derived amyloid can occur in various organs.</p>
<h3>Heredofamilial Amyloidosis</h3>
<p>Heredofamilial amyloidosis refers to a group of inherited disorders caused by mutations in specific genes, resulting in the production of abnormal precursor proteins that form amyloid fibrils. Examples include familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, and familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</p>
<h3>Hemodialysis-Associated Amyloidosis</h3>
<p>Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis occurs in individuals with end-stage renal disease who undergo long-term hemodialysis treatment. It is characterized by the deposition of beta-2 microglobulin, a protein normally cleared by the kidneys, in joints and other tissues.</p>
<h3>Localized Amyloidosis</h3>
<p>Localized amyloidosis refers to the deposition of amyloid fibrils in specific tissues or organs, typically without systemic involvement. Examples include localized cutaneous amyloidosis and amyloid deposits in the respiratory tract or urinary bladder.</p>
<h3>Endocrine Amyloid</h3>
<p>Endocrine amyloidosis is associated with the deposition of amyloid in endocrine glands, such as the pancreas (islet amyloid) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
<h3>Amyloid of Aging</h3>
<p>Amyloid deposits can also occur as a result of normal aging, without causing significant clinical symptoms or organ dysfunction. These deposits may be found in the heart, blood vessels, or other tissues.</p>
<h3>Clinical Features</h3>
<p>The clinical manifestations of amyloidosis depend on the organs and tissues affected by amyloid deposition. Common presentations include organ-specific symptoms such as heart failure, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, peripheral neuropathy, and macroglossia (enlarged tongue). Systemic symptoms may include weight loss, fatigue, and edema. The severity and course of the disease vary depending on the type and extent of amyloid deposition.</p>
