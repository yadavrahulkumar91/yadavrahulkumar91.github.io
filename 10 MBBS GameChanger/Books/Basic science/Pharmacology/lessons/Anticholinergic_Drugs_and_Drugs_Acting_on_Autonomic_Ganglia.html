      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Anticholinergic drugs are a class of medications that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system. These drugs are commonly used to treat various conditions such as overactive bladder, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory conditions, and certain neurological disorders.</p>
      <h1>Classification</h1>
      <p>Anticholinergic drugs can be classified into several categories based on their chemical structure and specific receptors they target. Some commonly used classes of anticholinergic drugs include:</p>
      <h2>Based on Receptor Target</h2>
      <h3> Muscarinic Antagonists</h3>
      <p>Muscarinic antagonists, also known as antimuscarinic agents, target muscarinic receptors and inhibit the action of acetylcholine. They are further classified into subgroups based on their selectivity for different muscarinic receptor subtypes. Some commonly used muscarinic antagonists include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Atropine</li>
        <li>Scopolamine</li>
        <li>Tropicamide</li>
        <li>Ipratropium</li>
        <li>Oxybutynin</li>
        <li>Tolterodine</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Nicotinic Antagonists</h3>
      <p>Nicotinic antagonists, or antinicotinic agents, block the action of acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors. They can be further classified based on their selectivity for different nicotinic receptor subtypes. Examples of nicotinic antagonists include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mecamylamine</li>
        <li>Hexamethonium</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Based on Therapeutic Use</h2>
      <h3> Antihistamines with Anticholinergic Properties</h3>
      <p>Some antihistamine medications possess anticholinergic properties in addition to their primary role in treating allergic reactions. These drugs block histamine receptors and also exhibit anticholinergic effects. Common antihistamines with anticholinergic properties include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diphenhydramine</li>
        <li>Chlorpheniramine</li>
        <li>Cyproheptadine</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Antispasmodics</h3>
      <p>Antispasmodic drugs are used to relieve smooth muscle spasms in various organs. Some antispasmodics also possess anticholinergic activity, contributing to their therapeutic effects. Examples of antispasmodics with anticholinergic properties include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dicyclomine</li>
        <li>Hyoscyamine</li>
        <li>Otilonium</li>
        <li>Pirenzepine</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Based on Organ System</h2>
      <h3> Ophthalmic Anticholinergics</h3>
      <p>Ophthalmic anticholinergics are a specific subgroup of antimuscarinic agents that are used to treat eye conditions by dilating the pupil and reducing excessive tearing. These drugs are administered topically and include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tropicamide</li>
        <li>Cyclopentolate</li>
        <li>Homatropine</li>
        <li>Atropine (in higher concentrations)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Gastrointestinal Anticholinergics</h3>
      <p>Gastrointestinal anticholinergics primarily act on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract to reduce motility and relieve spasms. They are commonly used in the treatment of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some examples of gastrointestinal anticholinergics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dicyclomine</li>
        <li>Hyoscyamine</li>
        <li>Pirenzepine</li>
        <li>Propantheline</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Respiratory Anticholinergics</h3>
      <p>Respiratory anticholinergics are primarily used to manage respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. These drugs help relax the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation. Common respiratory anticholinergics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ipratropium</li>
        <li>Tiotropium</li>
        <li>Aclidinium</li>
        <li>Umeclidinium</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Genitourinary Anticholinergics</h3>
      <p>Genitourinary anticholinergics are used to manage conditions involving the urinary system, such as overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. These drugs help reduce involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. Examples of genitourinary anticholinergics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Oxybutynin</li>
        <li>Tolterodine</li>
        <li>Solifenacin</li>
        <li>Darifenacin</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Central Nervous System Anticholinergics</h3>
      <p>Central nervous system (CNS) anticholinergics primarily affect the central nervous system and are used for various purposes, including the treatment of Parkinson's disease, motion sickness, and certain psychiatric conditions. Examples of CNS anticholinergics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trihexyphenidyl</li>
        <li>Biperiden</li>
        <li>Procyclidine</li>
        <li>Benztropine</li>
        <li>Scopolamine</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Mechanism of Action</h1>
      <p>Anticholinergic drugs exert their effects by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the body. Acetylcholine is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses between cells, and its inhibition leads to a decrease in the activity of cholinergic pathways.</p>
      <p>These drugs typically bind competitively to the muscarinic receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and activating the receptor. This blockade results in a reduction in parasympathetic activity, leading to various physiological and pharmacological effects.</p>
      <h1>Pharmacological Action on Different Systems and Organs of the Body</h1>
      <p>Anticholinergic drugs have widespread effects on different systems and organs of the body:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Central Nervous System:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects on the central nervous system. They can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, delirium or hallucinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular System:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can cause tachycardia (increased heart rate) by inhibiting the effects of acetylcholine on the heart's muscarinic receptors.</li>
        <li><strong>Respiratory System:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can relax the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation. They are used in the treatment of respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
        <li><strong>Gastrointestinal System:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can reduce gastrointestinal motility and secretion. They are used to treat conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and peptic ulcers.</li>
        <li><strong>Urinary System:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can relax the smooth muscles of the bladder, reducing urgency and frequency of urination. They are used in the treatment of overactive bladder.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can cause pupillary dilation (mydriasis) and cycloplegia (loss of accommodation) by blocking the cholinergic effects on the iris and ciliary muscles. They are used in ophthalmology for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</li>
      </ul>
