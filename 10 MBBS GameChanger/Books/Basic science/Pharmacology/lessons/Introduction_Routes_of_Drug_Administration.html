      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <h2>Pharmacology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pharmacology is the branch of science that studies how drugs interact with living organisms, their effects,
          and their applications.</li>
        <li>It encompasses the study of drug action, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What the body does to the drug?</li>
        <li>Pharmacokinetics refers to the study of how the body processes drugs, including their absorption,
          distribution, metabolism, and excretion.</li>
        <li>It focuses on understanding how drugs move within the body and how their concentration changes over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Absorption:</b> Ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
        </li>
        <li><b>Distribution:</b> It has a moderate volume of distribution, meaning it can distribute throughout the
          body's tissues.</li>
        <li><b>Metabolism:</b> Ibuprofen undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily through oxidation and
          glucuronidation processes.</li>
        <li><b>Elimination:</b> The majority of ibuprofen and its metabolites are eliminated through the kidneys via
          urine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What the drug does to the body?</li>
        <li>Pharmacodynamics involves the study of how drugs exert their effects on the body at the molecular, cellular,
          and systemic levels.</li>
        <li>It investigates the mechanisms of drug action, including receptor interactions, enzyme inhibition, and
          signal transduction pathways.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pharmacodynamics of Ibuprofen</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ibuprofen inhibits the enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) that are responsible for the production of
          prostaglandins.</li>
        <li>By reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins, ibuprofen exerts its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and
          antipyretic effects.</li>
        <li>It alleviates pain by reducing the sensitivity of pain receptors and diminishing the inflammatory response.
        </li>
        <li>Ibuprofen helps in reducing fever by acting on the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates body
          temperature.</li>
      </ul>



      <h2>Drug</h2>
      <h3>Definition of a Drug</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The World Health Organization defines a drug as any substance or product that is used or intended to be used
          to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the benefit of the recipient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sources of Drugs</h3>
      <h4>Natural Sources</h4>
