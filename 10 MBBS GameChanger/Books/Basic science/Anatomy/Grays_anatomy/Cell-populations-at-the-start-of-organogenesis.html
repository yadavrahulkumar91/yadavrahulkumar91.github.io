      <h1>Specification of the Body Axes and the Body Plan</h1>
      <h2>Embryonic Axes and Formation of Epiblast</h2>
      <p>Embryos have three orthogonal spatial axes: cephalocaudal, dorsoventral, and laterolateral, along with a temporal axis. The positioning of these axes in mammalian embryos occurs after the formation of early extraembryonic structures and the visualization of the inner cell mass. The future epiblast's position can be predicted when the blastocyst forms, and it becomes randomly located on the inside of the trophectoderm. The inner cell mass implants, but it is uncertain whether the trophectoderm initiates implantation or if the inner cell mass can move to a subjacent position after implantation.</p>
      <h2>Orientation and Folding of the Embryo</h2>
      <p>The embryonic disc, initially flat and two-dimensional, acquires axes that will be completely different in the folded three-dimensional embryo. Dorsal structures form from a central ellipse of the early flat embryonic disc, while lateral and ventral structures develop from the remaining portion of the disc. The edges of the disc become constricted at the umbilicus. Although part of the epiblast specifies the dorsal surface of the embryo, the inner layer (hypoblast) is not automatically a ventral structure.</p>
      <h2>Specification of Spatial Axes</h2>
      <p>The cephalocaudal axis is established with the appearance of the primitive streak in the bilaminar disc. The primitive streak patterns cells during ingression and specifies the dorsoventral axis, which becomes apparent after embryonic folding. Ingression through the streak confers axial, medial, or lateral characteristics on the forming mesenchyme cells. The medial and axial populations become dorsal structures in the folded embryo, while the lateral plate mesenchyme assumes lateral and ventral positions. The bilateral axis appears as a consequence of the development of the other two axes. Initially, the embryonic body halves are bilaterally symmetric, and lateral projections (upper and lower limbs) develop on each side of the body wall.</p>
      <h2>Temporal Modification and Chiral Arrangement</h2>
      <p>As development progresses, the original embryonic axes undergo temporal modifications. The cephalocaudal axis retains its segmental arrangement, while dorsal structures remain relatively unchanged. However, structures originally midline and ventral undergo extensive shifts and change from bilaterally symmetric to chiral arrangements, with distinct left and right sides.</p>
      <h2>Organogenesis and Body Plan</h2>
      <p>Organogenesis, the development of body organs and systems, begins after gastrulation and the establishment of a recognizable body plan. This typically occurs at stage 10 in human embryos. The head and tail folds are well formed, foregut and hindgut are enclosed, and the midgut is partly constricted from the yolk sac. Neural tube formation, somite segmentation, and the differentiation of mesenchyme are observed. Blood vessels, the heart, and the placental connection are developing. The embryo is connected to the placenta by the connecting stalk, and three different vesicles (amnion, yolk sac, chorionic cavity) are in contact with various embryonic layers.</p>
      <h2>Segmentation and Interactions</h2>
      <p>The early body plan of the embryo is segmented, and the boundaries between segments are maintained by the expression of specific genes and proteins. Organogenetic processes retain or replace the segmental plan depending on the structure. Improper specification of segments along the cephalocaudal axis can lead to anomalies in the modified segmental plan.</p>
      <h2>Developmental Constraints and Interdependence</h2>
      <p>The degree of developmental constraint during this period is debated. Comparative studies show variations in the developmental sequence among different embryonic species. Some developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, while others may have diverged and modified in different vertebrate species during evolution. Organogenesis occurs simultaneously in all body systems, and their development is interdependent and can influence each other. Therefore, studying the development of individual systems in relation to others is recommended.</p>


      <h1>Embryonic Cell Populations at the Start of Organogenesis</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The developmental processes operating in the embryo between stages 5 and 9 enable the construction of the bi- and trilaminar embryonic disc, the intraembryonic coelom, and new proliferative epithelia. From the end of stage 10, a range of local epithelial and mesenchymal populations interact to produce viscera and appendages. The inductive influences on these tissues and their repertoire of responses are very different from those seen at the onset of gastrulation.</p>
      <h2>Epithelial Populations in the Embryo</h2>
      <p>All epithelial populations express the cell polarity genes Crumbs, Scribble, and Baz/PAR-3. They display apical specializations, including primary cilia and microvilli, juxtaluminal junctions, and temporally and spatially specified basal laminae. Movement of fluid or proteins is limited between epithelial populations, creating barriers between developing tissues and organs.</p>
      <h3>Surface Ectoderm</h3>
      <p>The surface ectoderm shows regional differences in thickness during embryogenesis. Ectoderm over the dorsal region of the head and trunk is thin, while the pericardial covering is also thin due to expansion over enlarging structures. The surface ectoderm forms an upper layer called the periderm and a lower layer that differentiates into epidermis.</p>
      <h3>Ectodermal Ring and Ectodermal Placodes</h3>
      <p>The ectodermal ring on the head and lateral borders of the embryo is a zone of epithelial thickening. It contains populations of neuroectoderm, termed ectodermal placodes, which remain within the surface ectoderm until central nervous system development has progressed sufficiently. The ectodermal ring also encompasses the olfactory and optic placodes, pharyngeal arches, epibranchial placodes, and otic placodes. It overlays the frontonasal, maxillary, and mandibular processes and contributes to tooth buds and the outer coating of teeth.</p>
      <h3>Neural Ectoderm</h3>
      <p>The neuroepithelium at the time of primary neurulation is pseudostratified and forms all cell lines of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system.</p>
      <h3>Notochord</h3>
      <p>The notochordal plate undergoes a process similar to neurulation and forms an epithelial tube. The notochord is surrounded by a basal lamina and has inductive effects on the neural tube and adjacent somites.</p>
      <h3>Endoderm</h3>
      <p>The endoderm develops ahead of other portions of the endodermal epithelium. It gives rise to the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, biliary system, and urinary bladder and urethra.</p>
      <h3>Coelomic Epithelium</h3>
      <p>The coelomic epithelium lines the intraembryonic coelom and produces various populations, including the myocardium, connective tissue populations for the viscera, supporting cells for germ cells, and epithelial linings of urogenital tracts and pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal cavities.</p>
      <h3>Somites</h3>
      <p>Somites are discrete epithelial spheres formed by the transformation of paraxial mesoblast cells. They give rise to the base of the skull, vertebral column, ribs, skeletal muscle of the body, and dermomyotome.</p>
      <h2>Relative Dispositions of Epithelia</h2>
      <p>The relative dispositions of the neural, endodermal, and coelomic epithelia are shown in Figure 12.1.</p>

      <h1>Mesenchymal Populations in the Embryo</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The term 'mesenchyme' refers to unrestricted and undetermined cell populations that are arranged in three-dimensional structures. These cells express various surface signaling molecules and receptors and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagens, elastins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The composition of ECM, particularly the proportions of collagens and hydrophilic GAGs, is important for tissue development, migration, and cellular interactions mediated by growth factors.</p>
<p>Recent studies have focused on understanding the interactions between ECM stiffness, mechanotransduction of forces within mesenchymal populations, and their epigenetic roles during development.</p>
<h2>Mesenchymal Populations in Stage 10 Embryo</h2>
<p>In a stage 10 embryo, major mesenchymal populations are established. Mesoblast cells continue to generate at the primitive streak and move into the presomitic mesenchyme adjacent to the notochord. Some mesoblast cells also contribute to the lateral regions of the embryo. Here are the different mesenchymal populations in the embryo from stage 10 onwards:</p>
<h3>Axial Mesenchyme</h3>
<p>The first epiblast cells that ingress through the primitive streak give rise to the endoderm and notochord. Initially, they occupy a midline position. The population of cells that remain mesenchymal in contact with the floor of the neural groove, just rostral to the notochordal plate, is called the prechordal mesenchyme. These cells are tightly packed and become associated with the local paraxial mesenchyme. They migrate laterally into the periocular mesenchyme and give rise to the extraocular muscles.</p>
<h3>Paraxial Mesenchyme</h3>
<p>Mesenchyme adjacent to the notochord and developing neural tube is referred to as paraxial mesenchyme. It originates from epiblast cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingress through the primitive streak. The paraxial mesenchyme extends from the primitive streak to the prechordal plate. During somitogenesis, the paraxial mesenchyme undergoes mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation and forms epithelial somites. These somites give rise to skeletal muscle throughout the body.</p>
<p>The post-otic paraxial cell population is known as paraxial mesoderm in contemporary literature.</p>

<h2>Septum transversum</h2>
<p>Early mesenchyme invaginates through the middle part of the primitive streak and forms the wall of the pericardial coelom. The visceral pericardial wall gives rise to myocardium, while the parietal pericardial wall forms precardiac mesenchyme. The precardiac mesenchyme proliferates to form the septum transversum, separating the foregut endoderm from the pericardial coelom. Cells of the septum transversum give rise to the liver sinusoids, central portions of the respiratory diaphragm, and epicardium.</p>
<h2>Neural crest</h2>
<p>The neural crest arises from cells at the outermost edges of the neural plate. It gives rise to neuronal populations in the head and trunk, as well as non-neuronal mesenchymal cells in the head. Neural crest cells migrate to various locations and contribute to different developmental fates. Head neural crest surrounds the brain regions, pharyngeal arches, and forms connective tissues in the head. Trunk neural crest cells migrate dorsolaterally to form dorsal root ganglia, ventrally to form sympathetic ganglia and enteric nerves, and rostrocaudally along the aorta to form pre-aortic ganglia.</p>
<h2>Lateral plate</h2>
<p>Lateral plate refers to the mesoblast population lateral to the paraxial mesenchyme. It forms a continuous layer beneath the ectoderm and endoderm, creating the intraembryonic coelom. The somatopleuric mesenchyme, derived from the somatopleuric coelomic epithelium, lies subjacent to the ectoderm. The splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, derived from the splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium, surrounds the endoderm. The lateral plate contributes to the development of the appendicular skeleton, dermis of the skin, and plays a role in endodermal development.</p>
<h2>Somatopleuric mesenchyme</h2>
<p>Somatopleuric mesenchyme produces connective tissues and organizes the developing limbs. It interacts with the surface ectoderm to specify regions of the limb and contributes to the postaxial border of the limb. Somatopleuric mesenchyme gives rise to the bones, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, and dermis of the ventral and lateral body walls and limbs.</p>
<h2>Splanchnopleuric mesenchyme</h2>
<p>Splanchnopleuric mesenchyme surrounds the developing gut and respiratory tubes. It contributes connective tissue cells to the lamina propria and submucosa, and smooth muscle cells to the muscularis mucosae and muscularis externa. Splanchnopleuric mesenchyme also plays a role in endodermal development, specifying the region and villus type in the gut, and the branching pattern in the respiratory tract.</p>
<h2>Intermediate mesenchyme</h2>
<p>Intermediate mesenchyme is located between the somites and the lateral plate. It forms a loosely packed cord of cells and gives rise to the nephric system, gonads, and reproductive ducts.</p>



<h2>Angioblastic Mesenchyme</h2>
<p>Angioblastic mesenchyme consists of mesenchymal cells that give rise to the cellular elements of the blood, endothelium, and the mesenchymal layers of blood and lymphatic vessels. These cells originate from both extraembryonic and intraembryonic sources.</p>
<p>During postfertilization week 3, angioblastic mesenchyme forms from extraembryonic mesenchyme in the splanchnopleure of the yolk sac, the body stalk (containing the allantois), and the somatopleure of the chorion. These mesenchymal cells gradually merge to form a continuous network of fine vessels. Intraembryonic blood vessels first appear at the interface between the endoderm and mesenchyme within the lateral splanchnic mesenchyme at the caudolateral margins of the cranial intestinal portal.</p>
<p>The ventral (splanchnopleuric) mesenchyme, which interacts with the endoderm, has been found to possess angioblastic competence. On the other hand, the notochord, prechordal plate, and ectodermal tissues do not contain angiogenic cells. Angioblasts, which are precursors of angioblastic cells, can be derived from somites originating from paraxial mesenchyme. These angioblasts either differentiate with the somite derivatives or migrate to various regions of the embryo, including the neural tube, ventrolateral body wall, limb buds, mesonephros, and the dorsal part of the aorta.</p>
<p>Vasculogenesis is the process by which the earliest angiogenic mesenchymal cells form blood vessels. It involves the development of new vessels, such as endothelial heart tubes, dorsal aortae, umbilical vessels, and early vitelline vessels, in situ. Later on, vessels develop through angiogenesis, which is the sprouting and branching of new vessels from pre-existing ones. The surrounding non-angiogenic mesenchyme plays a role in determining the final pattern and specificity of the vessels, both morphologically and immunologically, as they become organ-specific and express organ-specific proteins.</p>
<p>It's important to note that blood cells have a different origin. They arise from extraembryonic tissues of the secondary yolk sac, with multiple waves of production occurring as haematopoietic stem cell precursors populate intraembryonic regions. The precursor populations for blood and lymphatic vessels are distinct from those producing blood cells.</p>
