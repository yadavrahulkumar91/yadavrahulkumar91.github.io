      <h1>Staging of Embryos</h1>
      <p>For the purposes of embryological study, prenatal life is divided into an embryonic period and a fetal period. The embryonic period covers the first 8 weeks of development (weeks following ovulation and fertilization resulting in pregnancy).</p>
      
      <h2>Embryonic Stages</h2>
      <p>The ages and stages of early human embryos were initially estimated by comparing their development with that of other embryos or with those of monkey embryos of known postovulatory ages.</p>
      
      <h3>Carnegie Embryonic Stages</h3>
      <p>A classification of human embryo development into 23 stages based on the internal and external features of embryos was developed by Streeter (1942), and continued by O'Rahilly and Müller (1987), from detailed histological study of approximately 600 sectioned embryos in the Carnegie collection.</p>
      
      <h3>Growth Tables and Ultrasonic Examination</h3>
      <p>Growth tables were constructed to predict the age of an embryo based on its size, specifically the greatest length. Ultrasonic examination of embryos in vivo has necessitated the revision of some of the ages related to stages.</p>
      
      <h3>Developmental Processes</h3>
      <p>The developmental processes occurring during the first 10 stages of embryonic life are shown in Fig. 8.1.</p>
      
      <h2>Comparative Timescales</h2>
      <p>Experimental studies on amniote embryos, particularly the chick, mouse, and rat, provide information on the early molecular processes of development. Figure 8.2 shows the comparative timescales of development between these species and human development up to stage 12.</p>
      
      <h2>Length and Age of Human Development</h2>
      <p>Figure 8.3 provides the length and age, in post-fertilization days, of human development during stages 10–23. The external appearance of embryos over this time is shown in Fig. 23.1, and stage is correlated to days and weeks in Fig. 23.3.</p>
      
      <h2>Developmental Age and Staging System</h2>
      <p>Information on developmental age after stage 23 (post-fertilization days 53–58) is shown in Fig. 23.4, where the developmental staging used throughout this book is juxtaposed with the clinical obstetric estimation of pregnancy based on the maternal last menstrual period.</p>
      <p>Care should be taken when reading developmental papers to clarify the staging system used to confer age in days on any embryos. All developmental publications using the Carnegie collection prior to 2010 use earlier estimations of age. Publications noting changes correlated to Carnegie stage (not age) still match Streeter and O'Rahilly and Müller publications.</p>
      
      <h4>Embryonic Stages Correction</h4>
      <p>All embryonic stages in this book are corrected to post-fertilization days based on O'Rahilly and Müller (2010).</p>
    

      <h1>Fertilization</h1>
      <p>The central feature of reproduction is the fusion of the two gamete pronuclei at fertilization. In humans, the male gametes are spermatozoa, while the female gametes are secondary oocytes released in the second meiotic metaphase.</p>
      
      <h2>Fertilization Process</h2>
      <p>Fertilization normally occurs in the ampullary region of the uterine tube, usually within 24 hours of ovulation. Spermatozoa must undergo capacitation and traverse the cumulus oophorus and corona radiata before binding to specific glycoprotein receptors on the zona pellucida (ZP3 and ZP2).</p>
      
      <h3>Acrosome Reaction and Fusion</h3>
      <p>Interaction of ZP3 with the sperm head induces the acrosome reaction, allowing the sperm to digest the zona pellucida and reach the perivitelline space. In the perivitelline space, the spermatozoon fuses with the oocyte microvilli through the interaction of disinTEGRIN peptides in the sperm head and integrin in the oolemma (Figs 8.4, 8.5A).</p>
      
      <h3>Calcium Wave and Polyspermy Block</h3>
      <p>Fusion of the sperm with the oolemma triggers a calcium wave that amplifies the signal at the site of sperm-oocyte interaction. The increase in calcium concentration leads to the resumption of cell division in the oocyte and prevents polyspermy through the release of cortical granules that modify the zona pellucida and oolemma.</p>
      
      <h2>Pronuclear Formation and Development</h2>
      <p>As the second polar body is extruded, the sperm head undergoes its protamine to histone transition. The two pronuclei form, move together, and are juxtaposed prior to pronuclear membrane breakdown/syngamy and cleavage after approximately 24 hours after sperm and oocyte association (Fig. 8.5B).</p>
      
      <h3>Importance of Pronuclei from Both Parents</h3>
      <p>The presence of the pronuclei from both parental origins is crucial for spatial organization and the controlled growth of cells, tissues, and organs. The maternal genome is relatively more important for embryo development, while the paternal genome is essential for the development of extraembryonic tissues.</p>
      
      <h3>Parental Imprinting and Imprinted Genes</h3>
      <p>Parental imprinting, the functional inequivalence of homologous parental chromosomes, occurs during the maturational phase of gamete production. Imprinted genes are heritable and can be silenced or expressed through DNA methylation. Imprinted genes play a role in blastocyst implantation, placentation, developmental growth rates, and the embryonic nervous system.</p>
      
      <p>Epigenetic modifications and changes to imprinted genes can lead to congenital anomalies and syndromes, affecting growth regulation and trajectory in early development.</p>
    


      <h1>In vitro fertilization</h1>
      <p>In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a successful way of overcoming most forms of infertility. Controlled stimulation of the ovaries enables the recruitment and maturation of multiple oocytes, which are then aspirated transvaginally. These oocytes are incubated with spermatozoa in a culture medium to achieve successful in vitro fertilization.</p>
      
      <h2>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</h2>
      <p>In cases of severe male-factor infertility, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is performed, where individual spermatozoa are directly injected into the oocyte. This technique is as successful as routine IVF.</p>
      
      <h2>Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT)</h2>
      <p>Embryos can be assessed through preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic/single gene diseases (PGT-M) or structural chromosomal rearrangements (PGT-SR). Biopsies are taken from the oocyte, early cleavage stage embryo, or blastocyst, and subjected to specific genetic testing.</p>
      
      <h3>Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A)</h3>
      <p>Oocytes and embryos can be biopsied and screened for errors in chromosome copy numbers using preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). Unaffected embryos can be identified for transfer to the recipient.</p>
      
      <h2>Cryopreservation and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)</h2>
      <p>Surplus embryos can be cryopreserved for later use. Cryoprotectants like propanediol or dimethylsulphoxide are commonly used for cryopreservation. The success rates of conception using ovarian stimulation, IVF, and transfers of fresh and cryopreserved embryos exceed those of natural conception.</p>
      
      <p>Worldwide, the prevalence of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is now extensive.</p>
      
      <h3>Longer-Term Effects and Imprinting Syndromes</h3>
      <p>Data collected on the longer-term effects of ART have indicated an increased risk of imprinting syndromes. The complexities of ART and the processes involved in oocyte and sperm collection, in vitro fertilization, blastocyst culture, and maternal endometrium manipulation challenge developmental conceptus-maternal interactions.</p>
      
      <p>Temporal conversations between oocyte/zygote/blastocyst and the mother are informed by dynamic exchange of environmental information, and their effects extend into fetal growth and postnatal life.</p>

      

      <h1>Preimplantation Development</h1>
      <h2>Cleavage</h2>
      <p>The first divisions of the zygote are termed cleavages. These divisions distribute the cytoplasm approximately equally among daughter blastomeres, resulting in an increase in cell number but a slight decrease in total mass of the preimplantation embryo.</p>
      
      <p>Cell division during cleavage can be asynchronous, and daughter cells may retain a cytoplasmic link through a midbody, as cytokinesis is delayed. Centrioles are not present until 16-32 cells, but amorphous pericentriolar material organizes the barrel-shaped mitotic spindles at this stage.</p>
      
      <p>Protein synthesis is essential for all cleavage divisions after fertilization, while mRNA synthesis is independent until the first eight cells. Activation of the embryonic genome is required after eight cells, as evidenced by experimental transcription inhibition leading to blockage of further division and development.</p>
      
      <p>The process of cleavage involves the synthesis of embryonically encoded proteins and the destruction of maternally derived mRNA as the embryonic genes become active. Compaction, which occurs after eight cells have formed, leads to the creation of a primitive proto-epithelial cyst consisting of eight polarized cells.</p>
      
      <p>During compaction, cells flatten and maximize intercellular contact, initiating the formation of gap and focal tight junctions. The cytoplasmic conformation changes from radially symmetric to highly asymmetric, involving the migration of nuclei, redistribution of surface microvilli, and the localization of endosomes.</p>
      
      <p>The entire process of compaction can function without mRNA and protein synthesis, relying on post-translational controls. E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in compaction and becomes phosphorylated at the initiation of compaction.</p>
      
      <p>Compaction is important for generating cell diversity in the early embryo. Daughter cells inherit cytocortical domains reflecting their origin and organization in the eight-celled embryo. Two populations of cells (polar and apolar) are formed in the 16-cell embryo, contributing to trophectoderm and inner cell mass, respectively.</p>
      
      <p>The generation of cell diversity and commitment to either trophectoderm or inner cell mass occur before blastocyst formation. During the 16-cell cycle, outer polar cells differentiate into an epithelial phenotype, while inner apolar cells remain symmetrically organized.</p>
      
      <p>After the division to 32 cells, outer polar cells complete their differentiation into a functional epithelium, forming tight junctions and desmosomes. The nascent trophectoderm engages in fluid transport to generate a cavity, expanding the morula into a blastocyst.</p>

      <h1>Blastocyst</h1>
      <p>Blastocysts can be broadly described based on the number of cells and the extent of the blastocoele, which correlate with developmental day/stage.</p>
      
      <p>Stage 3 of development corresponds to the free, unattached blastocyst at approximately 4 days post-fertilization. Early blastocysts have >35 cells with a cavity occupying <30% of the blastocyst volume. Mid-blastocysts have 64-100 cells with a cavity occupying 30-70% of the volume. Late blastocysts have 128-256 cells and the maximum cavity size within the zona pellucida. A hatched blastocyst has >256 cells and an expanding blastocoele.</p>
      
      <p>Blastocyst "hatching" from the zona pellucida occurs at 6-7 days, potentially assisted by an enzyme similar to trypsin. Trophoblast oozes out of a small slit, assuming a flattened polyhedral shape with ultrastructural features of a transporting epithelium. Hatched blastocysts expand, and differentiation of the inner cell mass proceeds.</p>
      
      <p>Single-cell embryo data analysis reveals the production of three cell lineages during blastocyst formation. Differentially expressed genes can be identified in the trophoblast, but not in the inner cell mass. The epiblast, forming the upper layer closest to the polar trophoblast, expresses different genes compared to the subjacent hypoblast, which gives rise to the yolk sac.</p>
      
      <p>In mammals, trophoblast lineage commitment occurs at species-specific time points related to implantation, and differentiation has started by the time the blastocyst reaches the endometrial cavity. In humans, trophoblast commitment is observed in late blastocysts with >180 cells.</p>
      
      <p>After hatching, the trophoblast surrounding the blastocyst cavity is called the mural trophoblast (cytotrophoblast), while the trophoblast adjacent to the inner cell mass is called the polar trophoblast (composed of both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast).</p>
      
      <p>Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is released by syncytiotrophoblast and becomes detectable in maternal serum by 6-8 days after fertilization.</p>
      
      <p>Human pregastrulation development has been studied through in vitro culture of donated embryos and human embryonic stem cells derived from human embryos. The cultured cells exhibit transcriptional distinctiveness from human epiblast and lose the usual imprinting established during blastocyst development. Studies are being conducted on stem cell lines of trophoblast and early endoderm, and trophoblast spheroids have been generated from human embryonic stem cells.</p>

      
      <h1>Attachment to the Uterine Wall</h1>
      <p>On the sixth postovulatory day, after approximately 72 hours in the uterine lumen, the blastocyst adheres to the uterine mucosa, initiating the events leading to the specialized and intimate contact between the trophoblast and endometrium.</p>
      
      <p>Implantation, the term used for this complex process, involves several stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dissolution of the zona pellucida</li>
        <li>Orientation and adhesion of the blastocyst onto the endometrium</li>
        <li>Trophoblastic penetration into the endometrium</li>
        <li>Migration of the blastocyst into the endometrium</li>
        <li>Spread and proliferation of the trophoblast, which envelops and specifically disrupts and invades the maternal tissues</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>The interactions between the hatched blastocyst and the maternal endometrium are not well understood. Developmentally competent embryos seem to enhance the uterine environment and promote their own implantation.</p>
      
      <p>Endometrial stromal cells and their decidualization play an important role in successful implantation and the interaction between the uterine wall and the blastocyst.</p>
      
      <p>The site of implantation is typically in the endometrium of the posterior wall of the uterus, closer to the fundus than to the cervix. It can occur in the median plane or to one side or the other. In some cases, implantation may happen elsewhere in the uterus or in an extrauterine or ectopic site.</p>

      <h1>Ectopic Implantation</h1>
      <p>An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the blastocyst implants at a location other than the uterine endometrium. The syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast invade the subjacent tissue, continue development, and secrete hCG, resulting in lower maternal serum levels compared to a uterine implantation.</p>
      
      <p>Almost all (95%) of ectopic implantations occur in the uterine tubes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Close to the fimbriae (11%)</li>
        <li>In the ampullae (70%)</li>
        <li>In the isthmus (2%)</li>
        <li>In the interstitial portion of the tubes where the tubal mucosa is adjacent to the uterine myometrium (2–4%)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Uterine implantations are often ipsilateral to the ovarian corpus luteum. Factors such as previous pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, tubal surgery, presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device, or use of progesterone-based oral contraceptives may predispose to ectopic pregnancy.</p>
      
      <p>Ovarian or abdominal pregnancies are exceptionally rare, highlighting the ability of the blastocyst to implant successfully into tissues other than a normal progestational endometrium. Development in such sites can be prolonged and is typically terminated by a mechanical or vascular accident, rather than by nutritive or endocrine insufficiency or immune maternal response. Abdominal implantation may occur on any organ, such as the bowel, liver, or omentum. In cases where the pregnancy continues, removal of the placenta at delivery or abortion is hazardous due to the risk of hemorrhage, so the placenta is usually left in situ to degenerate spontaneously.</p>
      
      <p>Most ectopic pregnancies are anembryonic. Ectopic pregnancies with a live embryo are the most dangerous because they grow rapidly and may be detected as early as 8 weeks of pregnancy, only when they have eroded the uterine tube wall and surrounding blood vessels.</p>
      
      <p>In the United States, approximately 2% of all pregnancies are ectopic. In the UK in 2011, the incidence was 11/1000, which is twice the rate noted between 1973 and 1999. The increase in incidence is associated with a higher occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease as well as improved diagnostic accuracy. The rate of recurrent ectopic implantation is 5–20% after a single prior ectopic implantation and more than 30% after two consecutive ectopic implantations. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are particularly associated with ectopic implantation. Interestingly, about 50% of patients with ectopic implantation have no identifiable risk factors.</p>
      <h1>Twinning</h1>

      <h2>Monozygotic Twins</h2>
      <p>Spontaneous twinning occurs once in approximately every 80 births. Monozygotic twins arise from a single ovum fertilized by a single sperm. During the development of the embryonic tissues, separation into two parts can occur, resulting in two complete embryos. The hatching of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida can lead to the constriction and separation of cells into two distinct entities. The frequency of monozygotic twinning increases with maternal age, possibly due to a gradual decrease in the average thickness of the zona pellucida.</p>
      <p>Although monozygotic twins have the same genotype, they often have differences in phenotypes, so the term "identical twins" is not entirely accurate. Late separation of twins from a single conceptus may result in conjoined twins, which can be equal or unequal, such as in acardia. After twinning, monozygotic embryos experience a period of intense catch-up growth. Despite starting out at half the size, each twin embryo or fetus reaches a size comparable to a singleton fetus in the second trimester of pregnancy but declines in relative size during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
    
      <h2>Dizygotic Twins</h2>
      <p>Dizygotic twins, resulting from multiple ovulations, are the most common form of twinning. They can be different sexes, although like-sex pairs are more common. The presence of two gestation sacs can be identified through ultrasound examination at around 4.5–5 postmenstrual weeks, while amniotic cavities become clearly visible around 8 postmenstrual weeks. Multiple births beyond twinning, such as triplets or quadruplets, can occur due to multiple ovulations or a single ovum, often seen in women treated with ovulation-stimulating drugs.</p>
    
      <h2>Placentation</h2>
      <p>The range of separation between twin embryos is reflected in the separation of the extraembryonic membranes. Different types of placentation can occur, with monoamniotic, monochorionic placentae associated with the highest perinatal mortality rate (50%). This mortality is caused by umbilical cord entanglement impeding blood supply and various vascular shunts between the placentae that may divert blood from one fetus to the other. Artery–artery anastomoses are the most common, followed by artery–vein anastomoses.</p>
      <p>Dizygotic twins have either completely separate chorionic sacs or fused sacs. These placentae are separated by four membranes: two amnions and two chorions. Additionally, these placentae have a ridge of firmer tissue at the base of the dividing membranes, resulting from the abutting of two expanding placental tissues against each other.</p>

      <h1>Formation of Extraembryonic Tissues</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The earliest developmental processes in mammalian embryos involve the production of extraembryonic structures that support and nourish the embryo during development. Production of these layers begins before implantation is complete. The origin of extraembryonic cell lines is still uncertain, but both trophoblast and inner cell mass contribute cells. The sequence of development of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in the early embryo is shown in Fig. 8.1.</p>
    
      <h2>Epiblast and Amniotic Cavity</h2>
      <p>Epiblast cells, located closest to the implanting face of the trophoblast, exhibit definite polarity. They are arranged radially with extensive junctions near the center of the cell mass. A basal lamina surrounds an initially spherical cluster of epiblast cells, isolating them from other cells except for a few contiguous cytotrophoblast cells. The epiblast cells adjacent to the hypoblast become taller and more columnar, causing the epiblast sphere to flatten and shifting the center towards the polar trophoblast.</p>
      <p>An amniotic cavity forms as amniotic fluid accumulates at the eccentric center of the lenticular epiblast mass. The amniotic cavity is roofed by low cuboidal cells with irregular microvilli. These cells share short apical junctional complexes and associated desmosomes, resting on an underlying basal lamina. The distinction between true amnion cells and the remaining definitive epiblast is clear.</p>
      <p>The columnar epiblast cells form a pseudostratified layer with microvilli, often containing a single cilium, clefted nuclei, and large nucleoli. They have a distinct continuous basal lamina. Cell division in the epiblast primarily occurs near the apical surface, leading to a more crowded apical region compared to the basal region. At the margins of the embryonic disc, the amnion cells are contiguous with the epiblast, exhibiting a gradation in cell size from columnar to low cuboidal within a two- to three-cell span (Fig. 8.10; see Fig. 9.1).</p>
    
      <h2>Further Development</h2>
      <p>Chapter 9 describes the additional development of the amnion and amniotic fluid.</p>

      <h1>Hypoblast and Yolk Sac</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The hypoblast is the lower layer of cells in the early bilaminar disc, also known as the anterior or distal visceral endoderm in mouse embryos. It consists of squamous cells just before implantation, exhibiting polarity with apical junctional complexes and microvilli facing the blastocyst cavity.</p>
    
      <h2>Hypoblast Subdivisions</h2>
      <p>During early implantation, the hypoblast extends beyond the edges of the epiblast and can be subdivided into visceral hypoblast (contacting the epiblast basal lamina) and parietal hypoblast (contacting the mural trophoblast). Parietal hypoblast cells are squamous, while visceral hypoblast cells are cuboidal. A space appears between the parietal hypoblast and the mural trophoblast, limiting the circumference of the hypoblastic cavity.</p>
    
      <h2>Yolk Sac Formation</h2>
      <p>The parietal hypoblast layer surrounding the initial cavity is referred to as the primary yolk sac. As development progresses, a secondary yolk sac forms, which is a smaller cavity lined by hypoblast. The method of secondary yolk sac formation may involve cavitation of visceral hypoblast, rearrangement of proliferating visceral hypoblast, or folding of the parietal layer of the primary yolk sac. Further development of the yolk sac is described in Chapter 9.</p>
    
      <h2>Role of Visceral Hypoblast Cells</h2>
      <p>Visceral hypoblast cells play important roles in early specification of cell lines and control of developmental timing. They induce the formation and position of the primitive streak, establishing the first axis of the embryonic disc. They also influence the timing of epiblast epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition at the primitive streak. Visceral hypoblast cells are necessary for successful induction of the head region and specification of primordial germ cells. They may contribute to the gut and play a role in the induction of cardiogenesis.</p>
    
      <h2>Allantois Formation</h2>
      <p>After the formation of the secondary yolk sac, a diverticulum of the visceral hypoblast called the allantois forms towards one end of the embryonic region. It extends into the local extraembryonic mesoblast, passing from the roof of the secondary yolk sac to the same plane as the amnion. Further development of the allantois is described in Chapter 9.</p>
    
      <h2>References</h2>

      <h1>Extraembryonic Mesoblast</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Extraembryonic tissues refer to all tissues that do not directly contribute to the future body of the definitive embryo or fetus. At stage 5, blastocysts are implanted but do not display trophoblastic villi, and they are approximately 7 to 12 days old.</p>
    
      <h2>Formation of Extraembryonic Mesoblast</h2>
      <p>The first formation of extraembryonic mesoblast occurs during this stage. It eventually covers the amnion, secondary yolk sac, internal wall of the mural trophoblast, and forms the connecting stalk of the embryo containing the allantoenteric diverticulum. The exact origin of this first mesoblastic extraembryonic layer is yet to be established, with proposed sources including the caudal region of the epiblast, parietal hypoblast, and subhypoblastic cells.</p>
    
      <h2>Development and Function</h2>
      <p>The initial mesoblastic extraembryonic layer gives rise to the extraembryonic mesoblast, arranged as a mesothelium with underlying extraembryonic mesenchymal cells. As development progresses, extraembryonic mesoblast populations expand beneath the cytotrophoblastic cells at the embryonic pole, forming the cores of developing villus stems. These villi and angioblastic cells give rise to capillaries and the earliest blood cells.</p>
    
      <h2>Attachment and Vascular Communication</h2>
      <p>Initially, the extraembryonic mesoblast connects the amnion to the chorion over a wide area. However, as the extraembryonic coelom develops and expands, this attachment becomes increasingly restricted. It eventually forms a connecting stalk between the future caudal end of the embryonic disc and the chorion, serving as a permanent pathway for vascular anastomoses around the allantois to establish communication with those of the chorion.</p>
