      <h1>Conceptus with a Bilaminar Embryonic Disc</h1>
      <p>
        At stage 6 of development, the conceptus (early embryo) consists of three cavities. The chorionic cavity, surrounded by trophoblast and developing villi, is lined with extraembryonic mesoblast. The chorion, trophoblast, and extraembryonic mesoblast enclose the extraembryonic coelom, which contains the smaller amniotic cavity and yolk sac. These structures come together at the embryonic bilaminar disc, where the epithelial epiblast and visceral hypoblast are close to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term "bilaminar disc" refers to the early embryonic disc, which does not yet have the definitive layers of embryonic ectoderm and endoderm that will give rise to embryonic structures. Only the epiblast layer will give rise to the actual embryo, while the other layers formed so far are involved in supporting and protecting the embryo. The amnion, chorion, and surrounding extraembryonic mesoblast are part of the outer layer, called the extraembryonic somatopleure, while the yolk sac, allantois, and surrounding extraembryonic mesoblast make up the inner layer, known as the extraembryonic splanchnopleure. These two layers merge at the margins of the embryonic area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms "epiblast" and "hypoblast" are used to differentiate between the earliest layers of the bilaminar disc and the later embryonic layers. The epiblast and hypoblast consist of mixed populations of cells that establish the placental structures and extraembryonic tissues before the production of embryonic cell lines during gastrulation. The older terminology that described three germ layers giving rise to the skin, gut lining, and other tissues is incorrect for the bilaminar and trilaminar embryonic disc. This persistent use of outdated terminology causes confusion and hinders the development of more accurate language to describe these early events. The three initial cell lineages that give rise to the extraembryonic membranes and the embryo are trophoblast, hypoblast, and epiblast.
      </p>
      <p>
        At early stage 6, the epiblast produces extraembryonic mesenchyme from its caudal margin. The appearance of the primitive streak marks the beginning of a period called gastrulation, during which significant rearrangements, migrations, and folding of the early embryo occur. The primitive streak contains organizer cells that initiate these processes. While human embryos do not form a gastrula in the same way as other organisms, the term "gastrulation" is still used to describe this early developmental period. During gastrulation, the epiblast forms a complex multilayered structure with a defined head-to-tail axis. By the end of gastrulation, cell populations from different regions of the embryonic disc become spatially related, and the basic shape of the embryo is formed.
      </p>


      <h2>Primitive Streak and Node</h2>
      <p>
        At stage 6 of development, when viewed from the dorsal (epiblastic) aspect, the embryonic disc appears elongated. It is during this stage that the primitive streak first becomes visible in the caudal region of the embryonic disc. The primitive streak consists of pluripotent cells aligned along its long axis in the middle, determining the future head-to-tail axis of the embryo. The region of the disc closest to the streak is referred to as "caudal," while the region farthest from the streak is called "rostral." As the streak develops, the terms "medial" and "lateral" can be used. The length and fate of cells passing through the primitive streak change as development progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formation of the primitive streak is induced by the underlying visceral hypoblast, which remains beneath the streak even in later stages. The primitive streak can be compared to the blastopore in lower vertebrates, such as amphibians, where the nodal region corresponds to the dorsal lip. Experiments have shown that the lip of the blastopore is a dynamic front where cells are carried inside to form the roof of the archenteron. Similarly, the primitive streak can be considered as the fused lateral lips of the blastopore, while the cloacal membrane and its surroundings are like the ventral lip of the blastopore.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the primitive streak, the epiblast cells undergo a period of rapid proliferation compared to the earlier stages of cleavage. Streak formation involves the production of several cell layers, disruption of the epiblast basal lamina, increased adhesive plaques and gap junctions, synthesis of vimentin, and loss of cytokeratins by the emerging cells.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the epiblast cells continue to proliferate, two ridges form on each side of the primitive streak, causing it to sink between them. The lower midline portion of the streak is called the primitive groove. The process by which cells become part of the streak and then migrate away beneath the epiblast is known as ingression, which is an example of epithelial to mesenchymal transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primitive node, also known as Hensen's node, is the most rostral (headward) region of the primitive streak. It appears as a curved ridge of cells resembling the top of an old-fashioned keyhole. Cells ingressing from the node move into the primitive pit (the most rostral part of the primitive groove) and then migrate in the headward direction beneath the epiblast. The primitive node plays a crucial role in producing axial cell populations, including the prechordal plate, notochord, embryonic endoderm, and the medial halves of the somites. Experimental removal of the node in avian embryos leads to the complete absence of the notochord and a failure of neurulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies on the dynamics of ingression at the primitive streak have shown movement not only of the overlying cells but also of the underlying extracellular tissues. Further research has revealed that vertical and convergent extension motion patterns, previously thought to be limited to the epiblast, also occur in the sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix fibronectin fibrils.
      </p>



      <h2>Position and Time of Ingression through the Primitive Streak</h2>
      <p>
        Research on cell fate has revealed that before their ingress through the primitive streak, epiblast cells are randomly distributed within the epiblast layer. The determination of the fate of epiblast cells occurs at or before the moment they pass through the primitive streak, indicating that the passage through the streak is the most critical factor for their future differentiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The position and time of ingress through either the streak or the node directly influence the developmental fate of cells. The fate of cells passing through the streak is specified based on their position and timing, such as passing through the node or different regions of the streak, including the rostral, middle, or caudal regions. Cells that ingress through the primitive node give rise to axial cell lines, including the prechordal mesenchyme, notochord, endoderm, and the medial halves of the somites. The rostral portion of the primitive streak produces cells for the lateral halves of the somites, while the middle streak generates the lateral plate mesoblast. The caudal portion of the streak contributes cells to the extraembryonic mesoblast until the somites become visible. The most caudal part of the streak gives rise to primordial germ cells, which can be distinguished histologically and histochemically. A diagram illustrating the position of ingress through the streak and node is shown in Figure 10.3. Epiblast cells that do not pass through the streak but remain within the epiblast population contribute to the neural and surface ectoderm of the embryo.
      </p>




      <h2>Prechordal Plate</h2>
<p>
The prechordal plate is a temporary collection of cells that underlies the neural plate during stage 9. It is first seen at stage 7 as a localized thickening of the endoderm rostral to the notochordal process. The prechordal plate consists of cells that are similar to or larger than the ingressing endodermal cells. It is composed of a highly developed mesenchymal mass in contact with the floor of the neural groove, rather than an epithelial layer. In stage 8 embryos, the prechordal plate can extend along the long axis of the embryonic disc and reach a depth of up to eight cells. By stages 9 and 10, the plate reduces in height to two cells deep as the cells at the lateral edge begin to migrate laterally as free mesenchymal cells. At stage 11, the prechordal mesenchyme forms bilateral premandibular mesenchymal condensations and is no longer a median structure. The exact extent of prechordal cells that remain within the endoderm is still uncertain.
</p>
<h2>Notochord</h2>
<p>
The notochord, also known as chordamesoderm, arises from the epiblast cells of the medial part of the primitive node. It goes through several stages of development, including the notochordal process and notochordal plate, before the definitive notochord is formed. The cells of the early notochordal process transiently express myogenic markers as they migrate beneath the epiblast. Later, they become epithelial, forming junctions and a basal lamina. The notochordal cells are intimately mixed with endodermal cells, as both cell lines ingress synchronously. During stage 8, the ingressing notochordal cells remain in the midline along the cephalocaudal axis. They form a rostral part continuous with the prechordal mesenchyme, a mid-portion arranged in a tube with a central notochordal canal, and a caudal epithelial layer called the notochordal plate, which is contiguous with the embryonic endoderm. The notochord is important for the maintenance and subsequent development of the neural floor plate and the induction of motor neurons. Experimental removal of the notochord results in the elimination of the neural floor plate and motor neurons and the expression of sensory neurons.
</p>
<h2>Caudal Eminence</h2>
<p>
The caudal eminence refers to the region between the neurenteric canal and the cloacal membrane, including the primitive streak, from stages 9 to 10. It consists of the caudal region of the trunk, composed of mesenchyme derived from the primitive streak and epiblast, and covered with surface ectoderm. While the prechordal and notochordal plates arise from cells ingressing through the primitive streak and node, the cells of the caudal eminence originate from local division of a mesenchymal population positioned caudal to the neurenteric canal. The caudal portions of the notochord, which form during later development when secondary neurulation processes begin, arise from these cell populations.
</p>
<h2>Embryonic Endoderm</h2>
<p>
Before ingression, definitive embryonic endoderm cells are found in the epiblast, located at the primitive node and rostral primitive streak. In the mouse, the endodermal cells lie beneath the epiblast mainly in the midline, interspersed with presumptive notochordal cells, forming the roof of the secondary yolk sac. The ingressing endoderm displaces the visceral hypoblast into the secondary yolk sac wall through a territorial expansion brought about by a change in cell morphology. The putative endoderm cells within the node are cuboidal epithelial cells, but they become squamous in the endoderm layer. A complete replacement of the visceral hypoblast has not been confirmed, and there may be a mixed population of cells in the early stages. In the human, cell ingression through the streak and node is apparent at stage 6, and by stage 7, a population of endoderm and notochord cells is present beneath the epiblast. The midline roof of the secondary yolk sac becomes populated mainly by the notochordal plate during stages 6 to 11, remaining in direct lateral continuity with the endodermal cells. The endoderm cells can join across the midline only after stage 11, once the definitive notochord is formed.
</p>


<h1>Embryonic Endoderm</h1>
<p>
Embryonic endoderm cells are found in the epiblast, specifically at the primitive node and rostral primitive streak. In mice, these cells are located beneath the epiblast in the midline, alongside presumptive notochordal cells, forming the roof of the secondary yolk sac. The ingressing endoderm displaces the visceral hypoblast into the secondary yolk sac wall through a territorial expansion caused by changes in cell morphology. While the exact replacement of the visceral hypoblast is not confirmed, there may be a mixed population of cells in the early stages. In humans, endoderm and notochord cells can be observed beneath the epiblast during specific stages.
</p>
<h1>Intraembryonic Mesoblast (Mesenchyme)</h1>
<p>
During development, epiblast cells undergo a transformation in phenotype and migrate individually through the primitive streak. As they elongate ventrally, they become flask-shaped cells, separating from the epithelial layer. These cells form free mesoblast cells and secrete an extracellular matrix that surrounds and separates them. They contact the basal lamina of the epiblast and migrate using filopodia and lamellipodia. The mesoblast cells form the paraxial mesenchyme when migrating through the primitive node and rostral primitive streak, while migration through the middle to caudal streak forms the lateral plate mesenchyme.
</p>
<h1>Embryonic Ectoderm</h1>
<p>
After cell ingression through the primitive streak is complete, the remaining epithelial cells in the epiblast layer are referred to as embryonic ectoderm cells. This layer consists of a mixed population of surface ectoderm cells and neural ectoderm cells. It is believed that the neural-fated cells were closest to the streak, while surface ectoderm cells were more rostral. Primary neurulation relocates most of the neuroepithelial cells.
</p>
<h1>Primordial Germ Cells</h1>
<p>
Primordial germ cells, which give rise to reproductive cells, are thought to arise from the epiblast ingressing at the caudal end of the primitive streak. It is unclear whether these cells migrate from rostral regions to the streak or originate from local caudal regions. These cells remain in the extraembryonic mesenchyme until the embryonic endoderm is formed and gastrulation is completed. They then migrate along the allantoic and hindgut endoderm as the embryo folds and develop further in the genital ridges.
</p>




<h1>Trilaminar Disc</h1>
<p>
The trilaminar disc, which forms around 23 days after ovulation, consists of three layers: the upper epiblast, the lower embryonic endoderm, and the middle mesoblast layer. However, it is important to note that the middle layer is several cells thick with extracellular matrix in between. The epiblast cells form a pseudostratified columnar epithelial layer, except at the primitive streak where cells ingress to form the other layers. The neural ectoderm arises from the centrally placed epiblast, while the surface ectoderm arises from the more lateral epiblast. The embryonic endoderm is a simple squamous layer with a basal lamina, but it may not be complete in the midline caudal to the prechordal plate.
</p>
<h1>Mesoblast Layer</h1>
<p>
The mesoblast layer is composed of free cells that migrate rostrally, laterally, and caudally from the primitive streak, producing extracellular matrix. It separates the epiblast and endoderm of the embryonic area and allows their migration. Paraxial mesenchyme refers to the mesoblast on each side of the notochord. Mesoblast passing rostrally flanks the notochordal plate and converges in the midline to form the cardiogenic mesoblast, which eventually develops into the heart and pericardium. Mesoblast passing laterally becomes confluent with the extraembryonic mesoblast, and mesoblast streaming caudally skirts the margins of the cloacal membrane and connects with the extraembryonic mesoblast of the connecting stalk.
</p>
<h1>Embryonic Ectoderm</h1>
<p>
The epiblast lateral to the midline contains both future surface ectoderm and neural ectoderm. The neural ectoderm forms a neural plate between the primitive node and buccopharyngeal membrane, with cells for the neural crest located along the junction between the neural plate and surface ectoderm. Some neuronal cells, known as ectodermal placodes, are arranged close to the neural crest or within the rostral limit of the neural plate.
</p>
<h1>Allantois</h1>
<p>
Adjacent to the cloacal membrane, the embryonic disc develops a midline diverticulum called the allantois. The allantois projects into the extraembryonic connecting stalk and its composition (visceral hypoblast, parietal hypoblast, or embryonic endoderm) is unclear. The allantois later develops a rich blood supply similar to the yolk sac.
</p>








<h1>Folding of the Embryo</h1>
<p>
Prior to folding, the trilaminar disc can be represented diagrammatically from the ectodermal aspect. The future external surface of the body is delimited, and the ends of the gut tube are specified at the buccopharyngeal and cloacal membranes. Between these membranes, the neural ectoderm proliferates, matching the migration of mesoblast from the primitive streak. As the paraxial mesenchyme segments, the edges of the neural plate elevate and initiate primary neurulation. Concurrently, the neural plate itself undergoes morphological changes. The medial cells become wedge-shaped, forming the neural groove, and further elevation of the neural groove edges allows fusion to form the neural tube. The surface ectoderm forms the dorsal epidermis, while neural crest cells remain as a mesenchymal population between the neural tube and surface ectoderm. Head folding begins at stage 9, with the rostral neural plate rising above the surface ectoderm, and the cardiogenic mesenchyme moves ventral to the developing brain. Tail folding occurs in stage 10 embryos, as the entire embryo rises above the level of the yolk sac, and the part of the disc caudal to the cloacal membrane repositions ventral to the neural plate. Lateral folding of the embryo is contributed by the ventral and medial movement of the lateral regions of the disc as the embryo rises above its edges.
</p>
<h1>Positioning of Body Structures</h1>
<p>
The positions of the main body structures are already specified in the unfolded embryo. The ectoderm lateral to the neural plate and paraxial mesenchyme will form structures within the back. The portion of the disc between the buccopharyngeal membrane and the edge of the disc will become the ventral thoracic wall and the ventral abdominal wall rostral to the umbilicus. Further caudally along the neural axis, the lateral portions of the disc will form the lateral and ventral abdominal walls of the trunk. The portion of the disc beyond the cloacal membrane will form the ventral abdominal wall caudal to the umbilicus. The circumference of the disc, where the embryonic tissue meets the extraembryonic membranes, will become restricted to the connection between the ventral abdominal wall and the umbilical cord, known as the umbilicus.
</p>




<h1>Formation of the Intraembryonic Coelom</h1>
<p>
At and just before stage 9, vesicles appear between the mesenchymal cells rostral to the buccopharyngeal membrane and within the rostral lateral plate mesenchyme. The mesenchymal cells at the periphery of the vesicles transform into epithelial cells, developing the characteristics of an epithelial phenotype. These vesicles merge to form a horseshoe-shaped tube called the intraembryonic coelom. It extends caudally to the level of the first somite and laterally into the lateral plate mesenchyme toward the extraembryonic mesenchyme. The epithelium adjacent to the ectoderm is called somatopleuric coelomic epithelium, while the epithelium adjacent to the embryonic endoderm is called splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium. At this stage, the intraembryonic coelom and the extraembryonic coelom do not communicate.
During the development of the head fold, the morphological movements that organize the foregut and buccopharyngeal membrane also affect the shape of the intraembryonic coelom. The midline portion of the coelom moves ventrally, while the caudal arms of the horseshoe remain in their original position. As a result, the midline part of the coelom, originally rostral to the buccopharyngeal membrane, comes to lie ventral to the foregut (caudal to the buccopharyngeal membrane), and the lateral extensions of the coelom pass close to the lateral walls of the foregut on each side. The caudal portions of the coelom turn 90° to lie lateral to the gut and communicate with the extraembryonic coelom ventrally.
Different compartments of the coelom give rise to specific body cavities during later development. The midline ventral portion, caudal to the buccopharyngeal membrane, becomes the pericardial cavity. The canals lateral to the foregut, known as pericardioperitoneal canals, become the pleural cavities and the upper part of the peritoneal cavity. The remaining portion of the coelom becomes the peritoneal cavity. By stage 11, the intraembryonic coelom extends caudally to the level of the caudal wall of the yolk sac, and the intraembryonic and extraembryonic coeloms communicate along the length of the embryo from the fourth somite level.
In the early embryo, the intraembryonic coelom serves as a route for the circulation of coelomic fluid, functioning as a primitive circulation system that delivers nutritive fluid deep into the embryo until it is replaced by the blood vascular system. The coelomic channel and the primitive circulation are important up to stage 13. From stage 10, exocoelomic fluid, propelled by the developing heart, comes into contact with the deeply placed mesenchyme, ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients to the growing embryonic tissues. From stage 12, the endothelial system expands and fills with plasma, which passes through the coelomic epithelium into the hepatocardiac channels in the pericardioperitoneal canals. The coelomic fluid collected from the chorionic cavity has a high protein content, providing nutrients to the embryo.
Although the coelom plays a crucial role in defining the body cavities and the coelomic epithelium produces important mesenchymal populations in the trunk, its overall contribution to the embryo has received little attention. The coelom is a tubular organ with a specialized wall enclosing a cavity, similar to the neural tube. The proliferating coelomic epithelium is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium that produces cells destined for different fates. The coelomic cells have apical epithelial specializations and basal processes in direct contact with the underlying mesenchyme. The potential role of the basal processes in directing migrating cells, similar to radial glia in the neural tube, has not been studied.
</p>



<h1>EMBRYONIC CELL POPULATIONS AT GASTRULATION</h1>
<p>After gastrulation, the cells of the embryo contribute to two fundamental types of tissue, epithelia and mesenchyme. Differentiation of specialized circulating blood cells and other cell types occurs in sequence. Embryonic and fetal cell types are replaced later in development or after birth.</p>
<h2>Epithelia</h2>
<p>Epithelial populations in the embryo have many of the morphological characteristics of differentiated epithelia, i.e. they are composed of sheets of closely packed, polarized cells, with narrow intercellular clefts containing minimal extracellular material, and a developed basal lamina containing specific proteins synthesized by the epithelium itself. The cells usually show juxtaluminal lateral surface specializations, (e.g. desmosomes, tight junctions or gap junctions) and specializations of the apical surface (e.g. microvilli or cilia).</p>
<p>Epithelial polarity factors establish the extent of the apical, lateral, and basal domains of the individual cells forming an epithelium. Three main control pathways have been identified in maintaining apicobasal polarity (St Jonston and Sanson 2011). The apical domain is specified by the Crumbs transmembrane protein; Baz/PAR-3 specifies the position and extent of the intercellular junction; and Scribble restricts the size of the junctional domains. Once established with an underlying basal lamina, the basal surface displays integrins. Changes in the morphology of an epithelial sheet will involve relative changes in the apical, lateral, and basal domains of all the cells in the sheet. Planar polarity of epithelia is driven by intercellular cortical actin and myosin. Epithelial cells are contiguous via actomyosin contractile networks, that contact the lateral cell membrane through E-cadherin adhesion (Gorfinkiel and Blanshard 2011). Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling pathways are involved in these epithelial morphogenetic movements and also in oriented cell division that occurs in epithelial sheets (Tao et al 2009).</p>
<p>Embryonic epithelia differ from those in the fetus and adult. Two distinct types can be identified. Early germinal epithelia, that give rise to epithelial or mesenchymal populations of the embryo and confer their early patterning are termed organizers, e.g. the primitive streak. Later germinal epithelia give rise to system-specific progenitor populations, e.g. the ventricular zone of the neural tube. All epithelia other than special germinal epithelia divide to produce embryonic growth throughout development and may retain stem cells that will divide throughout life.</p>
<p>Characteristically, epithelia clothe internal and external surfaces as simple or compound cellular sheets that separate phases of differing composition (e.g. the external environment and the subepithelial tissue fluids; intravascular and extravascular fluids). Traffic of materials in the intercellular clefts is limited. Traffic occurs across the cells because their limiting membranes, which function as energy-dependent selective barriers, enhance the passage of some materials and impede the passage of others.</p>
<h2>Mesenchyme</h2>
<p>The terms mesoblast and mesenchyme are used in this text in a specific manner and are not interchangeable. Previously, cells generated by the primitive streak, forming a population between the epiblast and hypoblast were termed mesoderm and, more recently, mesenchyme. The terms primary and secondary mesenchyme have been used to distinguish between those cells that arise from ingression through the primitive streak and those that arise from neural crest ingression from the edges of the neural plate, respectively. Primary mesenchymal cells revert to epithelia at their destinations. However, whereas some primary mesenchymal cells may become epithelial within a short timeframe, e.g. somites and lateral plate, other cells may transform later, e.g. the epithelium lining blood vessels. To address these terminological conflicts, the mixed population of epiblast cells that ingress through the primitive streak and come to lie between the epiblast and embryonic endoderm is termed mesoblast until the cells have migrated to their final position, at which time the populations of mesenchyme can be identified and their fates inferred.</p>
<p>Mesoblastic and mesenchymal cells have no polarity. They form junctional complexes, which are not exclusively juxtaluminal, and they produce extracellular matrix molecules and fibers from the entire cell surface. Mesenchymal populations are formed from a range of germinal epithelia and by proliferation of mesenchymal cells directly and occupy all the regions between the various epithelial layers described above. The term mesoderm is reserved for the coelomic epithelia that later form mesothelia.</p>
<p>Mesenchymal cells support epithelia throughout the developing body, both locally where they contribute to the basement membrane and form the lamina propria and smooth muscle of tubes, and generally where they differentiate into connective tissue. Specific mesenchymal populations control the patterning of local regions of epithelium (e.g. the zone of polarizing activity on the postaxial limb border posterior to the apical ectodermal ridge).</p>
<h2>Extracellular Matrix</h2>
<p>The space beneath epithelia and between mesenchyme cells is filled with extracellular matrix. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells synthesize extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors. Epithelial cells produce two-dimensional basal laminae that contain a variety of matrix molecules, including laminin, fibronectin, type IV collagen, and various proteoglycans. The particular molecules can vary during development according to spatial and temporal patterns, resulting in changes in the behavior of the underlying mesenchymal cells (e.g. in patterning of the basal regions of the skull). Mesenchymal cells produce extracellular matrix molecules in three dimensions. Those adjacent to an epithelial layer will connect with its basal lamina, forming a basement membrane that secures the epithelial layer to the underlying tissue. Cells deep within a mesenchymal population may synthesize matrix molecules (fibrillar or granular) to separate cells locally, open up migration routes, or leave information within the matrix to act on cell populations passing at a later time (see Fig. 11.1).</p>
<p>Molecules of the extracellular matrix are complex. They include more than 19 individual types of collagen (some capable of being individually spliced to give more than 100 variants), proteoglycans and glycoproteins (which come in a wide variety of forms, with and without binding proteins), and elastic fibers (Ch. 2). Hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan, has a vast capacity to bind water molecules and so create and structure the space between the mesenchymal cells, thereby producing much of the overall shape of an embryo. Experimental removal of hyaluronic acid prevents the formation of cell migration routes, removes the support for overlying epithelia, and disrupts the normal branching of glandular systems.</p>
<p>Fibronectin deposited extracellularly along a migration pathway will affect cells that touch it later, causing realignment of their intracellular actin filaments and thus of their orientation, and it also induces cell migration. The receptors for extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and laminin were originally termed integrins because they integrate extracellular proteins and intracellular cytoskeletal elements (via α and β subunits that span the cell membrane), allowing them to act together; the binding preference of integrins depends on their combination of subunits and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Extracellular matrix is structured rather than random. Epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations can structure the space around them by secretion of particular matrix molecules or growth factors, which, in turn, can organize the cells that contact them. Cell-matrix interactions and matrix-cell interactions control the position of migration routes and cellular "decisions" to migrate or to begin to differentiate. Matrix molecules propagate developmental instructions from cell to cell and form a far-reaching four-dimensional (spatial and temporal) mechanism of communication. Mapping the molecular pathways and the biomechanical processes that underlie morphogenesis, the dynamic epigenetics of early mesenchyme cells and their secreted three-dimensional extracellular matrices, and the mechanisms by which the stiffness of the surrounding matrix affects the actions of the cells within it, and how the specific deposition of fibrillary proteins creates tissue boundaries and zones of tension, remain the subject of ongoing research (e.g. Davidson et al 2010, Loganathan et al 2012, Loganathan et al 2016).</p>
<h2>Transition between Epithelial and Mesenchymal States</h2>
<p>Transformations of cell morphology from epithelium to mesenchyme, and vice versa, occur in specific places and times during development and can be seen as ways of dispersing germinal centers with increasing cell restriction. The first epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurs at the primitive streak, a germinal epithelium that confers embryonic specification on the resultant mesoblast population. The mesoblast so formed migrates, and the cells undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions when they reach their final destinations. Series of small epithelial germinal centers, the somites, are formed, as are larger, more extensive, germinal epithelial sheets that line the walls of the intraembryonic coelom. The coelomic walls, especially those derived from somatopleure and splanchnopleure, form germinal epithelia that give rise to the major mesenchymal populations that form the viscera. The early epithelial somites undergo further local epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions to form the sclerotomes and subsequently form several germinal epithelia in the epithelial plate of each somite. Later mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions are not associated with the formation of germinal epithelia; the most common involve the transition of mesenchyme into the endothelium of the vascular system. The nephrons of the mesonephric and metanephric systems also form from mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The generation of epithelial layers supported by underlying mesenchyme is widespread throughout the developing embryo and important for cellular interactions. The generation of two abutting epithelia with adjoining basal laminae is rare and seen within particular organs (Ch. 11).</p>
