      <h1>Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The glenohumeral joint is a synovial multiaxial spheroidal joint between the roughly hemispherical head of the <span class="bone">humerus</span> and the shallow glenoid fossa of the <span class="bone">scapula</span>.</li>
        <li>It is the most mobile joint in the body and the most frequently dislocated.</li>
        <li>The anatomy of the glenohumeral joint is a compromise between the requirements for motion and stability.</li>
        <li>Motion and stability depend on the surrounding muscular and soft tissue envelope more than on the shape and surface area of the articulating surfaces.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="joint">Joint Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span class="bone-process">humeral head</span> is held to the concave <span class="fossa"> glenoid fossa </span>by the compressive action of the <span class="muscle">rotator cuff muscles</span>.</li>
        <li>The stabilizing mechanism of the glenohumeral joint is one of concavity compression.</li>
        <li>The <span class="muscle">rotator cuff muscles</span> are attached to the proximal <span class="bone">humerus</span> through a <span class="tendon">musculotendinous envelope</span>.</li>
        <li>The deep surface of the <span class="tendon">musculotendinous envelope</span> fuses with the lateral part of the articular <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="bone-process">humeral head</span> is contained in a spherical space bounded medially by the glenoid fossa and elsewhere by the deep surface of the <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span> acts as a form of osseofibrous acetabulum.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Anatomical Boundaries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The walls of the spherical space containing the glenohumeral joint consist of:</li>
        <ol>

          <li>Coracoid anteriorly</li>
          <li>Coraco-acromial ligament anterosuperiorly</li>
          <li>Acromion and spine of the <span class="bone">scapula</span> posteriorly, posterosuperiorly, and posterolaterally</li>
          <li>Deep surface of deltoid anterolaterally and laterally</li>
        </ol>
        <li>This arrangement creates two gliding planes:</li>
        <ol>
          <span class="plane">


          <li>Internal gliding plane (glenohumeral articular gliding plane)</li>
          <li>External gliding plane (subcoracoid-subacromial-subdeltoid plane)</li>
        </span>
        </ol>
        <li>The external gliding plane is continuous with the plane under the <span class="bone">scapula</span> (scapulothoracic gliding plane).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Gliding and Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gliding in the glenohumeral joint is facilitated by the synovial lined cavities of the joint and the <span class="bursae"> subcoracoid, subacromial,</span> and <span class="bursae">subdeltoid bursae</span>.</li>
        <li>Infection, inflammation, and injury can cause adhesions and fibrosis in these gliding planes.</li>
        <li>Adhesions and fibrosis lead to a restriction of motion specific to the site and extent of adhesion.</li>
        <li>The surfaces of the gliding planes are extensive, and fibrosis can be very restricting.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Articulating surfaces</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The articular surfaces are reciprocally curved and termed <strong>ovoids</strong>.</li>
        <li>The humeral convexity has approximately four times the surface area of the glenoid concavity.</li>
        <li>Only a small portion of the humeral head opposes the glenoid in any position.</li>
        <li>The glenoid fossa has a greater radius of curvature in the coronal plane compared to the humeral head.</li>
        <li>The glenoid fossa is deepened by the glenoid labrum, a fibrocartilaginous rim.</li>
        <li>Both articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.</li>
        <li>The curvatures of the articular surfaces are not fully congruent in most positions, resulting in a loose-packed joint.</li>
        <li>Close-packing (full congruence) is likely achieved with the humerus abducted and laterally rotated.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2>Glenoid Labrum</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous rim around the glenoid fossa.</li>
        <li>Anteriorly, it is triangular in section; posteriorly, it is more ovoid; while inferiorly, it may be flattened and almost deficient.</li>
        <li>The labrum attaches securely to the superior edge of the glenoid fossa where it blends with the anterior and posterior fasciculi of the long tendon of biceps.</li>
        <li>Less secure attachment is found posteriorly, while relatively more secure attachment is found anteroinferiorly.</li>
        <li>An aperture may exist between the free deep edge of the labrum and the anterior glenoid rim above the midpoint of the fossa.</li>
        <li>In some cases, the anterior labrum may be absent, and its place is taken by a cord-like middle glenohumeral ligament.</li>
        <li>Patients with collagen deficiency but normal shoulder function (hypermobility syndrome) may have a hypoplastic or absent labrum, but their shoulders are not necessarily unstable.</li>
        <li>The labrum deepens the glenoid cavity, assisting in stabilizing the humeral head on the fossa.</li>
        <li>The exact mechanism of this stabilizing function and its role in bone protection and lubrication are still uncertain.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Fibrous Capsule</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A fibrous capsule envelops the joint.</li>
        <li>The capsule is attached medially to the glenoid neck and forms recesses anterior and posterior to the scapular neck.</li>
        <li>The supraglenoid tubercle, where the long head of biceps attaches, is intracapsular.</li>
        <li>Laterally, the capsule is attached near the articular margin of the anatomical neck of the humerus, descending more than 1cm on the calcar humerale inferomedially.</li>
        <li>The capsule's fibers are spiral-oriented, tightening during arm elevation to bring the articular surfaces closer together and contribute to concavity compression.</li>
        <li>In some individuals, there is an anterior oblique band of fibers passing from the region of the lesser tubercle to the lower part of the anterior rim of the glenoid fossa, with an uncertain contribution to stability.</li>
        <li>The lateral part of the external surface of the fibrous capsule blends with the tendons of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis, and the long head of triceps.</li>
        <li>The rotator interval, a triangular area of uncovered capsule, is reinforced by ligaments and fibers from the supraspinatus tendon.</li>
        <li>The inferior part of the capsule is least supported and subjected to the greatest strain in full abduction.</li>
        <li>There are two openings in the capsule: below the coracoid process and between the humeral tubercles.</li>
        <li>The opening below the coracoid process connects the joint cavity to a bursa enveloping the upper border of the subscapularis tendon.</li>
        <li>The opening between the humeral tubercles allows passage of the long tendon of biceps and its synovial sheath.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Ligaments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The ligaments associated with the glenohumeral joint are the glenohumeral (superior, middle, and inferior), coracohumeral, and transverse humeral ligaments.</li>
        <li>Ligaments only restrict specific joint motions when discrete parts become tight and act as "check-reins" at the limits of motion.</li>
        <li>Mechanoreceptors and nociceptors are clustered at the ends of ligaments, primarily on the glenoid side.</li>
        <li>The deep afferent innervation of the glenohumeral joint contributes to joint stability and facilitates rotator cuff activity within the normal range of shoulder motion.</li>
        
        <h3>Glenohumeral Ligaments:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The glenohumeral ligaments reinforce the capsule anteriorly and inferiorly.</li>
          <li><strong>Superior Glenohumeral Ligament:</strong> Extends from the supraglenoid tubercle to the fovea capitis. It plays a role in anterior stabilization and is part of the rotator interval.</li>
          <li><strong>Middle Glenohumeral Ligament:</strong> Provides anterior stability between 45° and 60° of abduction. It may be absent in some individuals without increasing shoulder instability.</li>
          <li><strong>Inferior Glenohumeral Ligament Complex:</strong> A hammock-like structure with anchor points on the anterior and posterior sides of the glenoid. It thickens anteriorly (anterior band) and posteriorly (posterior band), with an axillary pouch between them.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Coracohumeral Ligament:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The coracohumeral ligament attaches to the dorsolateral base of the coracoid process and extends as two bands, which blend with the capsule, to the greater and lesser tubercles.</li>
          <li>Portions of the coracohumeral ligament form a tunnel for the biceps tendon on the anterior side of the joint.</li>
          <li>The rotator interval is reinforced by the coracohumeral ligament.</li>
          <li>The ligament tightens in external rotation of the glenohumeral joint.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Transverse Humeral Ligament:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The transverse humeral ligament is a broad band that passes between the humeral tubercles.</li>
          <li>It is attached superior to the epiphyseal line and converts the intertubercular sulcus into a canal.</li>
          <li>The ligament acts as a retinaculum for the long tendon of biceps.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Synovial Membrane</h2>
        <p>
          The synovial membrane has the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It lines the capsule of the glenohumeral joint.</li>
          <li>It covers parts of the anatomical neck.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other important details about the synovial membrane include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The long tendon of biceps brachii passes through the joint in a synovial sheath.</li>
          <li>The synovial sheath of the biceps continues into the intertubercular sulcus, reaching the surgical neck of the humerus.</li>
          <li>The intra-articular bicipital sheath may be connected to the articular surface of the superior capsule by a mesotenon, which could be incomplete and present as one or several strands.</li>
          <li>This arrangement suggests that the biceps tendon was originally an extra-articular structure that invaginated, along with its synovial sheath, into the glenohumeral joint during development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bursae</h2>
        <p>
          The shoulder joint is associated with several bursae, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bursae located between the tendon of subscapularis and the capsule, which communicate with the joint between the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments.</li>
          <li>A bursa on the superior acromial aspect.</li>
          <li>A bursa between the coracoid process and the capsule.</li>
          <li>A bursa between teres major and the long head of triceps.</li>
          <li>Bursae located anterior and posterior to the tendon of latissimus dorsi.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, there are specific bursae in the shoulder region:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The subacromial bursa, located between the deltoid and the capsule, does not communicate with the joint cavity. It extends under the acromion and coraco-acromial ligament, as well as between them and the supraspinatus tendon.</li>
          <li>The subacromial bursa and the subdeltoid fascia appear to be attached to the acromion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other bursae may occasionally be present, including those behind the coracobrachialis muscle and between the tendon of infraspinatus and the capsule. In some cases, these bursae may open into the joint.
        </p>


        <h2>Vascular Supply</h2>
        <p>
          The glenohumeral joint receives its vascular supply from the following vessels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Branches from the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries.</li>
          <li>The suprascapular artery.</li>
          <li>The circumflex scapular artery.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Innervation</h2>
        <p>
          The main innervation of the glenohumeral joint is provided by the posterior cord of the brachial plexus through the subscapular nerves. Additionally:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The suprascapular nerve supplies the posterior and superior parts of the joint capsule.</li>
          <li>The axillary nerve supplies the anteroinferior part of the joint.</li>
          <li>The lateral pectoral nerve supplies the anterosuperior region, including the rotator interval capsule.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Factors maintaining stability</h2>
        <p>
          The glenohumeral joint poses a challenge for stability due to the articulation between the relatively large humeral head and the shallow glenoid fossa. Factors that help maintain stability include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ligaments: Glenohumeral ligaments (superior, middle, and inferior), coracohumeral ligament, and transverse humeral ligament.</li>
          <li>Labrum: The glenoid labrum deepens the glenoid cavity, contributing to the stability of the joint.</li>
          <li>Muscles: The rotator cuff muscles, including subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, play a crucial role in stabilizing the humeral head on the glenoid fossa.</li>
          <li>Capsule: The fibrous capsule surrounding the joint provides additional support and stability.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Movements at the Glenohumeral Joint</h2>
        <h3>Flexion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pectoralis major (clavicular part)</li>
          <li>Deltoid (anterior fibers)</li>
          <li>Coracobrachialis</li>
          <li>Biceps (assisting)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Extension</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Deltoid (posterior fibers)</li>
          <li>Teres major</li>
          <li>Latissimus dorsi (assisting)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Abduction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Supraspinatus</li>
          <li>Deltoid</li>
          <li>Subscapularis</li>
          <li>Infraspinatus</li>
          <li>Teres minor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Medial Rotation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pectoralis major</li>
          <li>Deltoid (anterior fibers)</li>
          <li>Latissimus dorsi</li>
          <li>Teres major</li>
          <li>Subscapularis (with the arm pendant)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lateral Rotation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Infraspinatus</li>
          <li>Deltoid (posterior fibers)</li>
          <li>Teres minor</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Glenohumeral Joint Dislocation</h2>
        <p>
          The glenohumeral joint is prone to dislocation, with most dislocations occurring anteriorly. This typically happens when the forearm is forced backward into greater lateral (external) rotation while in abduction, lateral rotation, and extension. Key points about glenohumeral joint dislocation include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anterior dislocation is more common, leading to the humeral head being displaced anterior to the glenoid rim and sometimes under the coracoid process.</li>
          <li>Dislocated shoulder loses its normal contour, with the acromion process becoming the most lateral bony structure, giving the shoulder a "squared-off" appearance.</li>
        </ul>
