      <h1>Implantation</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Implantation involves the initial attachment of the trophoblastic wall of the blastocyst to the endometrial luminal epithelium, stimulating the decidual response. The blastocyst spends approximately 72 hours within the uterine cavity before implantation, during which an interactive dialogue occurs between the blastocyst and endometrial decidual stromal cells.</p>
    
      <h2>Trophoblast Cell Types</h2>
      <p>The trophoblast of the blastocyst gives rise to three main cell types in the human placenta:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Syncytiotrophoblast: Forms the epithelial covering of the villous tree and serves as the main endocrine component of the placenta.</li>
        <li>Villous Cytotrophoblast: Represents a germinative population that proliferates throughout pregnancy and fuses to generate syncytiotrophoblast.</li>
        <li>Extravillous Trophoblast: Non-proliferative cells that invade the maternal endometrium.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Implantation Process</h2>
      <p>Following blastocyst apposition to the uterine mucosa, the polar trophoblast becomes externally covered with syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast penetrates between the epithelial cells without damaging the maternal cell membranes or disrupting intercellular junctions. Flanges of syncytiotrophoblast grow between the cells of the uterine luminal epithelium toward the underlying basal lamina.</p>
      
      <h2>Maternal Interaction and Decidualization</h2>
      <p>Implantation involves erosion of maternal superficial capillary endothelium and glandular epithelium, as well as phagocytosis of glandular secretions. Endometrial stromal cells encapsulate the blastocyst until it occupies an uneven implantation cavity in the stroma. The uterine surface is resealed, and the blastocyst burrows deeper into the endometrium. Syncytiotrophoblast forms over the mural cytotrophoblast during this process.</p>
    
      <h2>Decidua and Hormone Secretion</h2>
      <p>The syncytiotrophoblast does not express class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens but secretes hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG can be detected in maternal urine from as early as postfertilization day 10 and prolongs the life of the corpus luteum, which continues to secrete progesterone and estrogens until the placenta takes over hormone production.</p>
    
      <h2>Decidualization and Maternal-Fetal Interface</h2>
      <p>On successful implantation, menstruation ceases, and the endometrium transforms into the decidua, providing a suitable environment for the conceptus. Decidualization of the endometrial stroma occurs, and different regions of the decidua are named accordingly (decidua capsularis, decidua basalis, decidua parietalis). Regulatory interactions mediated by perivascular and stromal cells in distinct decidual layers help prevent harmful immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface in early human pregnancy.</p>

      <h1>Development of the Placenta</h1>

      <h2>Formation of the Placenta</h2>
      <p>The development of the human placenta follows a specific chronological order. It involves the formation of primary, secondary, and anchoring villi, as well as the modification of maternal blood vessels. By embryonic stage 10, a primitive circulation is established between the embryo and the secondary yolk sac. Blood vessels within the allantois and connecting stalk connect the embryonic circulation to the developing placenta during postmenstrual weeks 6-12.</p>
    
      <h2>Implantation and Syncytiotrophoblast Invasion</h2>
      <p>During implantation, the syncytiotrophoblast invades the uterine tissues, including the glands and walls of maternal blood vessels. The syncytiotrophoblast increases rapidly in thickness over the embryonic pole. Microvillus-lined clefts and lacunar spaces develop within the syncytiotrophoblastic envelope, which eventually enlarge and become intervillous spaces.</p>
    
      <h2>Development of Placental Villi</h2>
      <p>The projections of syncytiotrophoblast into the maternal decidua are called primary villi. They are invaded by cytotrophoblast and extraembryonic mesenchyme, forming secondary placental villi. Capillaries develop in the mesenchymal core of the villi. Cytotrophoblast within the villi continues to grow and makes direct contact with the decidua basalis, forming anchoring villi. Lateral projections from the main stem villus form true villi. Elongation of growing capillaries leads to the formation of terminal villi.</p>
    
      <h2>Extravillous Trophoblast Cells</h2>
      <p>As secondary villi form, single mononuclear cells detach from the anchoring cytotrophoblast and infiltrate the maternal decidua. These cells are called extravillous trophoblast cells and can be interstitial or endovascular. They invade the maternal spiral arteries from their adventitia or migrate along their lumens. Uterine natural killer (NK) cells interact with invading extravillous trophoblast cells and express human leukocyte antigens G and C (HLA-G, HLA-C).</p>
    
      <h2>Decidual Cells and Secretory Products</h2>
      <p>Decidual cells are stromal cells in the decidua that produce various secretory products. They contain glycogen, lipid, and vimentin-type intermediate filaments. Decidual cells produce secretory products like insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGF-BP1) and prolactin. Prolactin signals to the endometrial glands to increase their secretions and may play a role in the early phase of postimplantational development and histotrophic nutrition.</p>

      
      <h2>Formation of the Definitive Placenta</h2>
<p>The smooth muscle and internal elastic lamina in the maternal spiral arteries are replaced with extracellular fibrinoid deposits. In the central area of the basal plate, which will become the definitive placenta, the endovascular trophoblast plugs block the maternal spiral arteries until the end of the first trimester, restricting blood flow into the intervillous space. The trophoblast cells then migrate antidromically, against the flow of maternal blood, along the spiral arteries towards the inner myometrial region or junctional zone.</p>

<h2>Structure of the Definitive Placenta</h2>
<p>The definitive placenta consists of a chorionic plate on its fetal aspect and a basal plate on its maternal aspect. These two plates are separated by an intervening intervillous space containing villous stems with branches in contact with maternal blood. During the first trimester, the placenta develops in a low-oxygen environment and receives nutrition from the endometrial glands, which discharge into the intervillous space. When maternal blood bathes the surfaces of the chorion bounding the intervillous space, the human placenta is defined as haemochorial.</p>

<p>In other mammals, different grades of fusion exist between maternal and fetal tissues, such as epitheliochorial, synepitheliochorial, and endotheliochorial. The human placenta, vascularized by the allantoic blood vessels of the body stalk, is termed chorio-allantoic. It is also discoidal in shape, unlike placentas in other mammals, and deciduate, as maternal tissue is shed with the placenta and membranes during parturition as part of the afterbirth.</p>


<h2>Growth of the Placenta</h2>
<p>As the entire conceptus expands, the villi undergo radial growth, while the trophoblastic shell experiences integrated tangential growth and expansion. Each villous stem develops into a complex structure consisting of a single trunk attached to the chorion, with second- and third-order branches (intermediate and terminal villi) arising distally. Terminal villi are specialized for the exchange between the fetal and maternal circulations. They start as syncytial outgrowths that are invaded by cytotrophoblast cells. As the villi continue to grow, a core of fetal mesenchyme develops and becomes vascularized by fetal capillaries. The villi undergo sequential histological differentiation forming primary, secondary, and tertiary types.</p>

<p>Throughout gestation, terminal villi continue to form and branch within the definitive placenta, projecting in all directions into the intervillous space.</p>

<p>By postmenstrual week 8 (postfertilization week 6), the chorion is covered with villous stems that are continuous with the trophoblastic shell. The villi adjacent to the decidua basalis are stouter, longer, and more profuse. As the conceptus expands further, the decidua capsularis is progressively compressed and thinned, leading to the atrophy and disappearance of adjacent villi. This process starts at the abembryonic pole and eventually results in the smooth chorion apposed to the decidua capsularis, known as the chorion laeve. In contrast, the villous stems of the disc-shaped region of chorion apposed to the decidua basalis increase in size and complexity, forming the chorion frondosum. The chorion frondosum and the decidua basalis constitute the definitive placental site.</p>

<p>Abnormalities in this process can result in the persistence of villi at abnormal sites in the chorion laeve and the presence of accessory or succenturiate lobes within the membranes of the definitive placenta. In some cases, the entire villous ring of the primitive placenta may persist beyond postmenstrual week 8, leading to the development of placenta membranacea, a large placental structure that surrounds the entire gestational sac throughout pregnancy and covers the entire uterine cavity, including the internal os of the cervix.</p>

<h2>Decidual Changes and Placental Growth</h2>
<p>As the embryo grows and the amnion expands, the decidua capsularis is thinned and distended, and the space between the decidua capsularis and decidua parietalis is gradually obliterated. The three recognizable endometrial strata, compactum, spongiosum, and basale, become more differentiated and easily distinguishable. The glands in the spongiosum are compressed and appear as oblique slit-like fissures lined by low cuboidal cells.</p>

<p>By postmenstrual week 9, the decidua capsularis and decidua parietalis are in contact. The decidua capsularis is greatly thinned by postmenstrual weeks 17-20, and it almost disappears in the subsequent weeks.</p>

<h2>Placental Growth and Complications</h2>
<p>When the placenta grows in the area of a previous uterine scar, both the extravillous trophoblast and some of the villi may develop beyond the normal junctional zone of the inner myometrium. The villi may be adherent to the myometrium (placenta creta), invade deeper into the uterine wall (placenta increta), or extend beyond the uterine wall into the pelvis (placenta percreta).</p>

<p>During the formation of the membranes (postmenstrual weeks 8-12), focal bleeding often occurs in the periphery of the developing placenta. This complication, known as threatened miscarriage, is a common clinical complication of pregnancy and can lead to a complete miscarriage if the hematoma extends to the definitive placenta.</p>

<p>At full term (postmenstrual week 40), the placental diameter ranges from 200 to 220mm, with a mean placental weight of 500g and a mean thickness of 25mm. The total villous surface area is 12-14m², providing an extensive interface for maternal-fetal exchange. The uteroplacental circulation carries approximately 600ml of maternal blood per minute. The placenta does not contain lymph vessels or aggregates of lymphoid cells.</p>

<p>Systematic evaluation and careful description of the placenta after delivery have been recommended to correlate with later neonatal neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>


<h2>Chorionic Plate</h2>
<p>The chorionic plate is covered on its fetal aspect by amniotic epithelium. A connective tissue layer carries the main branches of the umbilical vessels on the stromal side of the epithelium. Below this layer, there is a diminishing layer of cytotrophoblast cells, followed by the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous space. The connective tissue layer is formed by the fusion between the mesenchyme-covered surfaces of the amnion and chorion. It is generally more fibrous and less cellular than Wharton's jelly found in the umbilical cord, except in the vicinity of larger vessels.</p>

<p>The umbilical vessels radiate and branch from the cord attachment, with variations in the branching pattern, until they reach the bases of the trunks of the villous stem. Within the intermediate and terminal villi, the umbilical vessels arborize. It's important to note that the vascular trees of adjacent stems do not anastomose.</p>

<p>The two umbilical arteries are typically joined at, or just before they enter, the chorionic plate by some form of substantial transverse anastomosis known as Hyrtl's anastomosis.</p>


<h2>Basal Plate</h2>
<p>The basal plate forms the outer wall of the intervillous space from the fetal to maternal aspect. It consists of layers of fibrinoid and basement membrane-like extracellular matrix that enmesh the trophoblast and adjacent decidua, creating a complex junctional zone.</p>

<p>In different areas, the basal plate contains syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, fibrinoid matrix, remnants of the cytotrophoblastic shell, and areas of necrotic maternal decidua known as Nitabuch's stria. Nitabuch's stria and the decidua basalis contain cytotrophoblast and multinucleated trophoblast giant cells derived from the extravillous interstitial cytotrophoblast population that infiltrates the decidua basalis. These cells penetrate the myometrium but are not found in the decidua parietalis or adjacent myometrium.</p>

<p>The striae of fibrinoid are irregularly interconnected and variable in prominence, extending into the adjacent decidua. The decidua contains remnants of the endometrial glands, large and small decidual cells, and an extensive venous plexus.</p>

<p>During mid-gestation, extravillous trophoblast cells gradually migrate laterally from the central area of the placenta towards the periphery. The invaded maternal vessels show dilation and altered responsiveness to vasoactive compounds.</p>

<p>The conversion of maternal spiral arteries into large-bore, low-resistance uteroplacental vessels is crucial for a successful pregnancy. Complications such as pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction are associated with the failure to achieve these changes. The area of the basal plate is often smaller in these pregnancy complications.</p>

<p>Between weeks 9 and 12, intercotyledonary septa develop in the basal plate, consisting of cytotrophoblast-covered syncytium that grows towards the chorionic plate. These septa divide the uterine surface of the placenta into lobes, called cotyledons, each surrounding a portion of the intervillous space associated with a villous trunk from the chorionic plate. In the second half of pregnancy, the basal plate undergoes progressive modifications, including thinning, increased deposition of fibrinoid, and a mixture of fetal and maternal components.</p>


<h2>Intervillous Space</h2>
<p>The intervillous space contains the main trunks of the villous stems and their branches, which are the essential structural and functional units of the placenta.</p>

<p>In the spiral arteries leading to the intervillous space, the walls consist of a fibrinoid matrix and embedded cytotrophoblast. This arrangement allows for the expansion of arterial diameter, slowing down arterial inflow and reducing perfusion pressure. Veins draining blood from the intervillous space pierce the basal plate and join uterine veins.</p>

<p>During early pregnancy, the extravillous trophoblast invades the uterine tissues and forms a continuous shell at the decidua level. This shell anchors the placenta to maternal tissue and plugs the tips of uteroplacental arteries. The shell and plugs create a labyrinthine interface that filters maternal blood, allowing slow plasma seepage but no true blood flow into the intervillous space. This establishes a low-oxygen environment that protects the developing embryo and influences placental tissue development.</p>

<p>A well-developed cytotrophoblastic shell is crucial for a successful pregnancy. Impairment in its formation can affect trophoblast invasion and utero-placenta remodeling, leading to adverse outcomes such as preterm labor, miscarriage, and hemorrhage.</p>

<p>By the end of the first trimester, the extravillous trophoblastic plugs are dislocated, allowing maternal blood to flow freely within the intervillous space. During this period, the placental free membranes form, the chorionic cavity is obliterated, and maternal blood flows throughout the entire placenta. These changes facilitate nutrient and gas exchange between maternal and fetal circulations.</p>




<h2>Structure of a Placental Villus</h2>
<p>The chorionic villi play a crucial role in the exchange of substances between the mother and fetus. The villous tissues that separate fetal and maternal blood are functionally important. Branching occurs from the chorionic plate into the villous tree, with stem villi giving rise to intermediate and terminal villi.</p>

<p>Each villus consists of a core of connective tissue containing various types of collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV. Overlying this matrix are cytotrophoblast cells and the syncytiotrophoblast, which are in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. The cytotrophoblast cells are connected by desmosomes.</p>

<p>During development, the cytotrophoblast gradually forms a continuous layer of syncytiotrophoblast on the basal lamina, which becomes progressively thinner. Cytotrophoblastic sprouts covered in syncytium are present in the early stages, representing the development of new villi. Columns of cytotrophoblast cells at the tips of anchoring villi extend from the villous basal lamina to the maternal decidual stroma.</p>

<p>The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated epithelium that serves as an active tissue layer and acts as a selectively permeable barrier. It allows the passage of water, oxygen, nutrients, hormones from mother to fetus, and some waste products from fetus to mother. It also secretes placental hormones into the maternal circulation.</p>

<p>The core of the villus contains reticulum cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages (Hofbauer cells). Mesenchymal cells differentiate into small reticulum cells and then into fibroblasts or large reticulum cells. The stromal channels found in immature intermediate villi become infilled by collagen, forming the fibrous stroma characteristic of the stem villus.</p>

<p>The villi also contain fetal placental vessels, including arterioles and capillaries, but no lymphatic vessels. Pericytes are found in close association with the capillary endothelium. Syncytial knots and syncytial sprouts are specialized structures within the syncytiotrophoblast, with sprouts indicating trophoblast proliferation.</p>

<p>Lipid droplets and glycogen are present in both the trophoblast layers and the villous core. Glycolysis is maintained in placental tissues to preserve carbon skeletons for various cellular processes. Fibrinoid deposits are found on the villous surface, possibly serving as a repair mechanism.</p>



<h2>Structure of a Placental Villus</h2>
<p>Chorionic villi are essential for the exchange of substances between the mother and the fetus. The villous tissues separating fetal and maternal blood play a crucial functional role. The villous tree branches out progressively from the chorionic plate, starting with stem villi and continuing with intermediate and terminal villi.</p>

<p>Each villus consists of a core of connective tissue containing various types of collagen, such as collagen types I, III, V, and VI, as well as fibronectin. The core also contains laminin and collagen type IV in the stroma associated with basal laminae. Over this matrix, there are cytotrophoblast cells and a syncytiotrophoblast layer that is in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space.</p>

<p>The cytotrophoblast cells, which are adjacent to each other and the syncytium, are connected by desmosomes. Initially, the cytotrophoblast forms a continuous layer on the basal lamina, but it gradually gives rise to the syncytiotrophoblast, which becomes thinner and covers a larger area over time. Cytotrophoblastic sprouts covered in syncytium are present in the early stages of villi development.</p>

<p>The syncytiotrophoblast is the multinucleated epithelium of the placenta and serves as the primary site for transplacental transport. It acts as a selectively permeable barrier, allowing the passage of water, oxygen, nutrients, hormones from the mother to the fetus, and some waste products from the fetus to the mother. It also secretes various placental hormones into the maternal circulation.</p>

<p>Syncytial knots and syncytial sprouts are specialized structures within the syncytiotrophoblast. Syncytial sprouts are markers of trophoblast proliferation and represent the early stages of new villi development. Syncytial knots are aggregates of nuclei with condensed chromatin and may serve to remove senescent nuclear material from metabolically active areas of the syncytiotrophoblast.</p>

<p>The core of the villus contains reticulum cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages (Hofbauer cells). The reticulum cells appear to create a collagen-free stromal channel system through which Hofbauer cells migrate. The stroma of the villi becomes densely fibrous with collagen as the pregnancy progresses.</p>

<p>The fetal placental vessels include arterioles and capillaries but not lymphatic vessels. Pericytes are found near the capillary endothelium, and the vessels are externally surrounded by a basal lamina. In the terminal villi, dilated capillaries are located immediately adjacent to the villous trophoblast, reducing the distance between the maternal and fetal circulations to a few micrometers. The endothelial cells of these vessels are non-fenestrated and connected by tight and adherens junctions.</p>


<h3>Transport across Placental Villi</h3>
<p>
The placental barrier allows the exchange of substances between the mother and fetus. Different mechanisms are involved in the transfer of substances:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gaseous exchange occurs through simple diffusion.</li>
  <li>Ions and water-soluble solutes transfer through paracellular and transcellular diffusion and transport.</li>
  <li>Glucose transfer involves facilitated diffusion.</li>
  <li>Active transport mechanisms carry calcium ions and some amino acids.</li>
  <li>Transfer of vitamins varies, with water-soluble vitamins B and C passing readily.</li>
  <li>Substances of high molecular weight, such as complex sugars, lipids, and proteins, have varying rates of transfer and likely involve selective transport mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Lipids can pass through the trophoblast cells to the core of the villus.</li>
  <li>Maternal antibodies (immunoglobulins) transfer to the fetus through micropinocytosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The placenta also functions as an endocrine organ, producing and secreting hormones like various estrogens, progesterone, hCG, and hCS (placental lactogen). Enzymes in the trophoblast are involved in hormone synthesis and inactivation of maternal hormones.
</p>
<p>
Migration of leukocytes across the placental barrier and the passage of some fetal and maternal red blood cells can occur, especially during delivery. This may have implications for Rhesus incompatibility and other conditions.
</p>
<p>
Many drugs, including small molecules, can cross the placental barrier, potentially causing teratogenic effects on the fetus, depending on the gestational age and maternal dosage. Maternal alcohol and drug use, tobacco smoke, and certain infections can have adverse effects on fetal development.
</p>
<p>
Various bacteria, protozoa, and viruses can cross the placental barrier, while others are acquired by the fetus during delivery. Toxoplasma, CMV, and Plasmodium falciparum invade the villous trophoblast, while rubella can cause congenital anomalies when present in early pregnancy.
</p>

</p>



<h2>FETAL MEMBRANES</h2>
<p>
The implanting conceptus consists of three cavities: the chorionic cavity (surrounded by trophoblast), the amniotic cavity, and the secondary yolk sac. The chorionic cavity becomes lined with extraembryonic mesoblast, and a fourth cavity called the allantois develops later. The chorion consists of trophoblast and extraembryonic mesothelium, varying in thickness during development. The yolk sac undergoes primary and secondary phases of development, playing a role in nutrient uptake and processing. The allantois is involved in angiogenesis and gives rise to umbilical vessels. The amnion develops from the edges of the embryonic disc and forms an avascular membrane that extends along the connecting stalk and umbilical cord.</p>
<h2>Chorion</h2>
<p>
The chorion consists of developing trophoblast and extraembryonic mesothelium. It varies in thickness throughout gestation, with the thickest part at the implantation site. At term, the chorion consists of cellular and fibroblastic layers. It has an outer layer of cytotrophoblast and occasional obliterated villi. Trophoblast infiltration of the decidua parietalis does not occur.</p>
<h2>Yolk Sac</h2>
<p>
The yolk sac is the oldest extraembryonic membrane. It goes through primary and secondary phases of development, forming a cavity lined with parietal and visceral hypoblast. It plays a role in absorbing molecules from the chorionic cavity and mediates their movement to the embryonic gut and circulation. The yolk sac becomes coated with extraembryonic mesenchyme and develops a capillary plexus.</p>
<h2>Allantois</h2>
<p>
The allantois is an outgrowth from the yolk sac that becomes canalized and gives rise to the umbilical vessels. The allantoic duct connects to the hindgut and persists in the proximal end of the umbilical cord.</p>
<h2>Amnion (chorio-amnion)</h2>
<p>
The amniotic cells develop from the embryonic disc and form the amniotic cavity, which expands and contacts the chorion to create the chorio-amnion. The amniotic membrane has a simple cuboidal epithelium with selective permeability properties. It undergoes changes towards full term, and increasing numbers of amniotic cells undergo apoptosis. Human amniotic epithelial cells are pluripotent and express neural, glial, and hepatocyte markers. The amnion is used in medical procedures such as corneal repair and vaginal reconstruction.</p>
<p>These fetal membranes undergo prenatal changes, such as thinning of the chorion in preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and infection or inflammation can affect brain development and postnatal gut maturation.</p>



<h1>Amniotic Fluid</h1>
<p>Amniotic fluid (liquor amnii) provides a buoyant medium that supports the delicate tissues of the young embryo, allows free movement of the fetus up to the later stages of pregnancy, and diminishes the risk to the fetus of injury from outside. </p>
<p>Amniotic fluid is derived from multiple sources throughout gestation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secretions from amniotic epithelium</li>
<li>Filtration of fluid from maternal vessels via the parietal decidua and amniochorion</li>
<li>Filtration from the fetal vessels via the chorionic plate or the umbilical cord</li>
<li>Fetal urine and fetal lung secretions</li>
</ul>
<p>In early pregnancy, diffusion from intracorporeal vessels via the non-keratinized fetal skin also provides a source. Once the gut is formed, fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is a normal occurrence, and the fluid is absorbed into the fetal circulation.</p>
<h2>Amniotic Fluid Volume</h2>
<p>Amniotic fluid volume increases logarithmically during the first half of pregnancy. It starts from less than 10ml at postmenstrual week 8 and reaches 30ml at postmenstrual week 22. By postmenstrual week 28, the volume increases to 770ml. After postmenstrual week 30, the volume may remain unchanged until postmenstrual week 36, after which it decreases towards the expected delivery date. Volumes decrease sharply in post-term gestation, averaging 515ml at postmenstrual week 41.</p>
<p>Human fetal urine output from the metanephric kidney increases from 110ml/kg/day at postmenstrual week 25 to almost 200ml/kg/day at full term postmenstrual week 40, which corresponds to almost 1000ml/day. The rate of human fetal lung secretion has not been measured but is presumed to be in the range of 60–100ml/kg/day near full term.</p>
<p>Experimental animal studies indicate that lung fluid production is about one-third that of urine production, and that half of the fluid leaving the lungs enters the amniotic fluid and half is swallowed. It has been estimated that human fetuses swallow up to 760ml/day of amniotic fluid near term, although this decreases in the days before delivery. The remainder of the amniotic fluid is thought to be absorbed via an intramembranous pathway directly across the amniotic cavity and fetal surface of the placenta into fetal blood vessels. Intramembranous flow is thought to reach 400ml/day at term.</p>
<h2>Assessment of Amniotic Fluid</h2>
<p>Amniotic fluid volume is estimated at routine antenatal ultrasound scans, despite some concerns about its objectivity. It may be expressed as an amniotic fluid index.</p>
<p>A deficiency of amniotic fluid is termed oligohydramnios, and absent amniotic fluid is anhydramnios. Oligohydramnios in the second or third trimester is usually the result of urinary tract malformations, e.g., bilateral renal agenesis or obstruction of the lower urinary tract, uteroplacental insufficiency, or premature rupture of the membranes. The urachus may play a critical role in the resolution of oligohydramnios in lower urinary tract obstruction by acting as a fistula between the bladder and the amniotic space. The major concern with oligohydramnios at less than postmenstrual week 20 is the significant risk of pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death.</p>
<p>A volume of amniotic fluid in excess of 2 liters in the second half of pregnancy is generally considered abnormal and constitutes polyhydramnios. Maternal causes include cardiac and renal problems and diabetes mellitus, which causes fetal hyperglycemia and polyuria. Fetal causes include reduced fetal swallowing due to congenital anomalies, e.g., anencephaly, upper intestinal tract obstruction (esophageal and duodenal atresia), compressive pulmonary disorders (congenital respiratory diaphragmatic hernia), and neuromuscular impairment of swallowing.</p>
<h2>Composition of Amniotic Fluid</h2>
<p>For many years, amniotic fluid was regarded as a medium that physically supported the developing embryo and fetus. More recently, it has also been conceptualized as part of the embryonic and early fetal extracellular matrix, and its composition throughout pregnancy has been investigated. Techniques for biochemical analysis have compared amniotic fluid, fetal umbilical cord blood, and maternal serum.</p>
<p>Early in development, amniotic fluid resembles blood plasma but also demonstrates extremely low oxygen tension, reflecting the physiological placental hypoxia noted in the first trimester. In the second and third trimesters, primary electrolytes are similar in amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and maternal serum, whereas glucose, cholesterol, and some enzymes are markedly lower in amniotic fluid. Umbilical cord blood and maternal serum contain 8 and 12.5 times more protein, respectively, than amniotic fluid. More than 100 metabolites, including cortisol and a range of cytokines, have been detected in amniotic fluid. The concentrations of most cytokines differ from those in maternal blood and reflect the physiological status of the fetus. Proteomic analysis of human amniotic fluid at postmenstrual weeks 16–18 has identified more than 800 proteins and peptides. It appears that amniotic fluid may be acting as a pathway for the transport of signaling molecules to target cells. In experimental animal studies, substances injected into the amniotic cavity were detected within the embryos within 2 minutes, demonstrating a rapid exchange with all fetal tissues in these models.</p>


<h1>Umbilical Cord</h1>
<p>The umbilical cord consists of an outer covering of amniotic epithelial cells and an interior mass of diverse mesenchyme. It contains the vitelline-intestinal and allantoic ducts, as well as the associated vitelline and allantoic (umbilical) blood vessels.</p>
<p>The mesenchymal core of the umbilical cord is derived from different sources, including the somatopleuric extraembryonic mesenchyme, the splanchnopleuric extraembryonic mesenchyme of the yolk stalk, and the allantoic mesenchyme of the connecting stalk. These compartments fuse and transform into the loose connective tissue known as Wharton's jelly.</p>
<p>The umbilical vessels undergo modifications during intraembryonic circulation. The vitelline vessels involute, while most of the allantoic (umbilical) vessels persist. The right umbilical vein disappears, but the two umbilical arteries typically remain. The vessels of the umbilical cord often twist into a helical shape, ranging from a few turns to over 300 turns.</p>
<p>Anomalies of the fetal anterior abdominal wall, such as exomphalos and gastroschisis, can affect the arrangement of the outer covering of amnion cells near the proximal end of the umbilical cord.</p>
<p>Mature umbilical vessels have a strong muscular coat that contracts in response to mechanical stimuli. The outermost bundles follow a spiral course and produce shortening of the vessel and narrowing of the lumen when contracted. The fully developed umbilical cord is typically around 50cm long and 1-2cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The distal end of the umbilical cord is usually attached to the central portion of the placenta. Velamentous insertion, where the cord attaches to the membranes, occurs in a small percentage of pregnancies and can be associated with cord vessels running in the free placental membranes (vasa previa).</p>
<p>Artificial reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, are associated with a higher incidence of placental and cord anatomical anomalies.</p>
