      <h1>B. CLAVICLE</h1>
      <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The clavicle (Latin a small key) is a long bone.</li>
          <li>It supports the shoulder so that the arm can swing clearly away from the trunk.</li>
          <li>The clavicle transmits the weight of the limb to the sternum.</li>
          <li>The bone has a curved part called the shaft, and two ends, lateral and medial.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>II. Side determination</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>The side to which a clavicle belongs can be determined from the following characters.</li>
          <ol type="i">
              <li>The lateral end is flat, and the medial end is large and quadrilateral.</li>
              <li>The shaft is slightly curved, so that it is convex forwards in its medial two-thirds, and concave forwards in its lateral one-third.</li>
              <li>The inferior surface is grooved longitudinally in its middle one-third.</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>III. Peculiarities of the Clavicle</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>It is the only long bone that lies horizontally.</li>
          <li>It is subcutaneous throughout.</li>
          <li>It is the only long bone which ossifies in membrane.</li>
          <li>It is the first bone to start ossifying.</li>
          <li>It is the only long bone which has two primary centres of ossification.</li>
          <li>There is no medullary cavity.</li>
          <li>It is occasionally pierced by the middle supraclavicular nerve.</li>
          <li>
              <h3>Weight transmission</h3>
              <p>It receives weight of upper limb via lateral one-third through coracoclavicular ligament and transmits weight of upper limb to the axial skeletal via medial two-thirds part (see Flow chart 1.1).</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>IV. Features</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3>Shaft</h3>
              <p>The shaft is divisible into the lateral one-third and the medial two-thirds.</p>
              <ol type="i">
                  <li>The lateral one-third of the shaft is flattened from above downwards.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>It has two borders, anterior and posterior.</li>
                      <ol>
                          <li>The anterior border is concave forwards.</li>
                          <li>The posterior border is convex backwards.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <li>This part of the bone has two surfaces, superior and inferior.</li>
                      <ol>
                          <li>The superior surface is subcutaneous.</li>
                          <li>The inferior surface presents an elevation called the conoid (Greek cone) tubercle and a ridge called the trapezoid ridge.</li>
                      </ol>
                  </ul>
                  <li>The medial two-thirds of the shaft is rounded and is said to have four surfaces.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The anterior surface is convex forwards.</li>
                      <li>The posterior surface is smooth.</li>
                      <li>The superior surface is rough in its medial part.</li>
                      <li>The inferior surface</li>
                      <ol>
                          <li>has a rough oval impression at the medial end.</li>
                          <li>The lateral half of this surface has a longitudinal subclavian groove.</li>
                          <li>The nutrient foramen lies at the lateral end of the groove.</li>
                      </ol>
                  </ul>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Lateral and Medial Ends</h3>
              <ol type="i">
                  <li>The lateral or acromial (Greek peak of shoulder) end is flattened from above downwards.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>It bears a facet that articulates with the acromion process of the scapula to form the acromioclavicular joint.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>The medial or sternal end is quadrangular and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni to form the sternoclavicular joint.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The articular surface extends to the inferior aspect, for articulation with the first costal cartilage.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VI. OSSIFICATION</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>
              <h3>a. The clavicle is the first bone in the body to ossify (Fig. 2.3).</h3>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>b. Except for its medial end, it ossifies in membrane.</h3>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>c. It ossifies from two primary centres and one secondary centre.</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>The two primary centres appear in the shaft between the fifth and sixth weeks of intrauterine life, and fuse about the 45th day.</li>
                  <li>The secondary centre for the medial end appears during 15-17 years and fuses with the shaft during 21-22 years.</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>1) Occasionally there may be a secondary centre for the acromial end.</li>
                  </ul>
              </ol>
          </li>
      </ol>
  
      <h2>VII. CLINICAL ANATOMY</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <h3>a. The clavicle is commonly fractured by falling on the outstretched hand (indirect violence).</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <h4>i. The most common site of fracture is the junction between the two curvatures of the bone, which is the weakest point.</h4>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <h4>ii. The lateral fragment is displaced downwards by the weight of the limb as trapezius muscle alone is unable to support the weight of the upper limb (Fig, 2.4).</h4>
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>b. The clavicles may be congenitally absent or imperfectly developed in a disease called cleidocranial dysostosis.</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <h4>i. In this condition, the shoulders droop and can be approximated anteriorly in front of the chest (Fig.2.5a and b).</h4>
                  </li>
              </ul>

          <div>
           Humerus is the largest bone of upperlimb.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The humerus is a long bone located in the upper arm, extending from the shoulder joint to the elbow joint. It is the largest bone of the upper limb and consists of various features and regions.</p>

<h2>2. Side Determination</h2>
<p>The humerus can be distinguished as either the left or right bone based on specific anatomical features. These features include the position of the greater tubercle, lesser tubercle, and the orientation of the trochlea.</p>

<h2>3. Features</h2>

<h3>a. Upper End</h3>
<p>The upper end of the humerus consists of the following structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Head: The rounded portion of the humerus that articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula, forming the shoulder joint.</li>
  <li>Greater Tubercle: A prominent bony projection located on the lateral side of the humerus, serving as an attachment site for various muscles and tendons.</li>
  <li>Lesser Tubercle: A smaller bony projection situated on the anterior surface of the humerus, also providing attachment for muscles and tendons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>b. Shaft</h3>
<p>The shaft of the humerus is the long, cylindrical portion connecting the upper and lower ends. It contains various anatomical landmarks and regions, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deltoid Tuberosity: A roughened area located on the lateral aspect of the humerus, serving as the attachment site for the deltoid muscle.</li>
  <li>Radial Groove: A shallow groove on the posterior surface of the humerus, providing passage for the radial nerve.</li>
  <li>Surgical Neck: A constricted region just below the greater and lesser tubercles, which is a common site for fractures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>c. Ossification</h3>
<p>The humerus undergoes a process called ossification during development. It initially forms from several separate bones that eventually fuse together to form the mature bone.</p>

<h2>4. Clinical Anatomy</h2>
<p>The clinical anatomy of the humerus involves its relationship to various structures and its importance in medical procedures, such as fracture management, joint replacements, and surgical approaches.</p>

      <h3>Ulna and Radius</h3>
      <div>
        Ulna and Radius lies side by side.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The radius is one of the two long bones located in the forearm, alongside the ulna. It extends from the elbow to the wrist and plays a crucial role in forearm movement and support.</p>

<h2>2. Side Determination</h2>
<p>The radius can be distinguished as either the left or right bone based on specific anatomical features, such as the orientation of the radial tuberosity and the styloid process.</p>

<h2>3. Features</h2>

<h3>a. Upper End</h3>
<p>The upper end of the radius consists of the following structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>i. Head: The rounded proximal end of the radius that articulates with the capitulum of the humerus and the radial notch of the ulna.</li>
  <li>ii. Neck: The narrowed region just below the head of the radius.</li>
  <li>iii. Radial Tuberosity: A roughened projection located on the medial aspect of the radius, serving as the attachment site for the biceps muscle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>b. Shaft</h3>
<p>The shaft of the radius is the long, slender portion connecting the upper and lower ends. It consists of specific borders and surfaces:</p>

<h4>i. Borders</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Anterior Border: The front-facing edge of the radius.</li>
  <li>Posterior Border: The back-facing edge of the radius.</li>
  <li>Medial or Interosseous Border: The inner border of the radius that is in close proximity to the ulna.</li>
</ol>

<h4>ii. Surfaces</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Anterior Surface: The front-facing surface of the radius.</li>
  <li>Posterior Surface: The back-facing surface of the radius.</li>
  <li>Lateral Surface: The outer surface of the radius.</li>
</ol>

<h3>c. Lower End</h3>
<p>The lower end of the radius includes multiple surfaces:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Anterior Surface: The front-facing surface of the distal end of the radius.</li>
  <li>Posterior Surface: The back-facing surface of the distal end of the radius.</li>
  <li>Medial Surface: The inner surface of the radius that is in close proximity to the ulna.</li>
  <li>Lateral Surface: The outer surface of the distal end of the radius.</li>
  <li>Inferior Surface: The lower surface of the distal end of the radius.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Attachments</h2>
<p>The radius serves as an attachment site for various muscles, tendons, and ligaments involved in forearm movement and stability.</p>

<h2>5. Ossification</h2>
<p>The radius undergoes a process called ossification during development. It forms through both primary and secondary centers of ossification.</p>

<h3>a. Primary Center</h3>
<p>The primary center of ossification is located in the midshaft of the radius and is responsible for the initial formation of the bone.</p>

<h3>b. Secondary Center</h3>
<p>The secondary centers of ossification are found at the ends of the radius, contributing to the growth and maturation of the bone.</p>

<h2>6. Clinical Anatomy</h2>

<h3>a. Colles' Fracture</h3>
<p>Colles' fracture is a common type of distal radius fracture where the bone breaks near the wrist joint, resulting in the displacement of the distal fragment.</p>

<h3>b. Smith's Fracture</h3>
<p>Smith's fracture, also known as a reverse Colles' fracture, occurs when the distal fragment of the radius is displaced in the opposite direction, towards the palm.</p>

<h3>c. Pulled Elbow</h3>
<p>Pulled elbow, also called nursemaid's elbow, is a condition commonly seen in children where the radius becomes partially dislocated from the elbow joint, typically due to a sudden pull or jerk.</p>
