      <h2>Latin Terminology</h2>
      <p>The majority of anatomical nomenclature is based on Latin terms. Latin was chosen as the language for anatomical naming due to its widespread usage in scientific literature and its historical significance in the field.</p>
      <h2>Anatomical Position</h2>
      <p>Anatomical nomenclature is based on the anatomical position, which serves as a standard reference point. The anatomical position is defined as standing upright, facing forward, with arms at the sides and palms facing forward.</p>
      <h2>Terminology Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Anatomical nomenclature follows a hierarchical structure to describe the organization of the body. The hierarchy starts with larger structures and progresses to smaller and more specific structures.</p>
      <h2>Terms for Location and Orientation</h2>
