<h2>Classification of Synovial Joints</h2>
<p>Synovial joints, based on the number of axes they rotate around and the range of motion they allow, can be classified into four main categories: plane joints, uniaxial joints, biaxial joints, and multiaxial joints. Here is a detailed classification of synovial joints:</p>
<h3>Plane Joints</h3>
<p>Plane joints, also known as gliding joints, allow for sliding or gliding movements between the articulating surfaces. They have flat or slightly curved surfaces and provide limited motion in multiple directions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Examples: Intercarpal joints, intertarsal joints, acromioclavicular joint</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uniaxial Joints</h3>
<p>Uniaxial joints allow movement around a single axis. They permit motion in one plane or along one axis of rotation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hinge Joints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Elbow joint, knee joint, ankle joint</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Pivot Joints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Atlas-axis joint (C1-C2), proximal radioulnar joint</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Biaxial Joints</h3>
<p>Biaxial joints allow movement around two perpendicular axes. They permit motion in two planes or along two axes of rotation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Condyloid Joints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Wrist joint, metacarpophalangeal joints</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Saddle Joints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Thumb (first carpometacarpal) joint</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Multiaxial Joints</h3>
<p>Multiaxial joints, also known as ball-and-socket joints, allow movement around multiple axes. They permit motion in three planes or around three axes of rotation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ball-and-Socket Joints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Examples: Shoulder joint, hip joint</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Classification of Joints</h2>
<p>Joints can also be classified based on their functional characteristics, which describe the degree of movement they allow. The functional classification of joints includes three main categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses.</p>
<h3>Synarthroses (Immovable Joints)</h3>
<p>Synarthroses are joints that allow little to no movement. These joints provide stability and support to the skeletal system. The bones in synarthroses are tightly bound together by fibrous connective tissue or cartilage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sutures: Found only in the skull, sutures are fibrous joints that connect the cranial bones. They are immovable and provide protection to the brain.</li>
  <li>Synchondroses: These cartilaginous joints are found in areas where growth is still occurring, such as the epiphyseal plates of growing long bones. They allow minimal movement during growth.</li>
  <li>Syndesmoses: Syndesmoses are fibrous joints that allow a small amount of movement. An example is the distal tibiofibular joint.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amphiarthroses (Slightly Moveable Joints)</h3>
<p>Amphiarthroses are joints that allow limited movement. These joints provide both stability and flexibility to the skeletal system. The bones in amphiarthroses are connected by fibrocartilage or hyaline cartilage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Symphyses: Symphyses are cartilaginous joints found between bones connected by fibrocartilage. An example is the pubic symphysis in the pelvic region.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diarthroses (Freely Moveable Joints)</h3>
<p>Diarthroses are joints that allow a wide range of movement. These joints are highly mobile and permit various types of movements, such as flexion, extension, rotation, and abduction. The bones in diarthroses are separated by a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Synovial Joints: Synovial joints are the most common and functionally versatile joints in the body. They include hinge joints, ball-and-socket joints, pivot joints, condyloid joints, saddle joints, and plane joints. These joints allow for extensive movement and provide flexibility and mobility to the skeletal system.</li>
</ul>







<h2>Regional Classification of Joints</h2>
<p>Joints can also be classified based on their location in the body. The regional classification of joints divides them into different anatomical regions, highlighting their specific locations and functions. Here are some examples of the regional classification of joints:</p>
<h3>Articulations of the Skull</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sutures: Fibrous joints that connect the cranial bones of the skull.</li>
  <li>Temporomandibular Joint: A synovial joint that connects the mandible to the temporal bone of the skull.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vertebral Joints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intervertebral Joints: Cartilaginous joints located between adjacent vertebrae. These joints provide flexibility and shock absorption in the spine.</li>
  <li>Zygapophyseal (Facet) Joints: Synovial joints located between the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. These joints facilitate spinal movement and stability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shoulder and Upper Limb Joints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint: A synovial ball-and-socket joint between the head of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the scapula.</li>
  <li>Elbow Joint: A synovial hinge joint formed by the articulation of the humerus, radius, and ulna.</li>
  <li>Wrist Joint: A synovial condyloid joint formed by the articulation of the radius, ulna, and carpal bones.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hip and Lower Limb Joints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hip Joint: A synovial ball-and-socket joint between the head of the femur and the acetabulum of the hip bone.</li>
  <li>Knee Joint: A synovial hinge joint formed by the articulation of the femur, tibia, and patella.</li>
  <li>Ankle Joint: A synovial hinge joint formed by the articulation of the tibia, fibula, and talus bone.</li>
</ul>









<h2>Classification of Joints Based on Structural Complexity</h2>
<h3>Simple Joints (Synovial)</h3>
<p>Simple joints involve the articulation of two bones and are characterized by the presence of a joint capsule and synovial membrane. These joints allow a wide range of movements. Examples of simple joints include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hinge Joints: These joints allow movement in one plane, similar to the opening and closing of a hinge. Examples include the elbow joint and knee joint.</li>
  <li>Ball-and-Socket Joints: These joints allow movement in multiple planes and rotation. Examples include the shoulder joint and hip joint.</li>
  <li>Pivot Joints: Pivot joints enable rotational movement around a central axis. Examples include the atlantoaxial joint, where the atlas (C1 vertebra) rotates around the dens (odontoid process) of the axis (C2 vertebra).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compound Joints (Fibrous or Cartilaginous)</h3>
<p>Compound joints involve more than two bones and can be either fibrous or cartilaginous in nature. These joints provide more stability but have limited movement compared to simple joints. Examples of compound joints include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distal Radioulnar Joint: This joint is a fibrous joint between the radius and ulna bones near the wrist.</li>
  <li>Tibiofibular Joints: These are fibrous joints that connect the tibia and fibula bones.</li>
  <li>Symphyses: Symphyses are cartilaginous joints found between bones connected by fibrocartilage. An example is the pubic symphysis in the pelvic region.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Complex Joints (Combination of Different Types)</h3>
<p>Complex joints involve multiple articulations, combining different types of joints within the same structure. These joints provide both stability and a wide range of movement. An example of a complex joint is the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which combines a hinge joint and a gliding joint.</p>
