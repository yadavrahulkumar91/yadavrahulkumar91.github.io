      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The glenohumeral joint is a synovial multiaxial spheroidal joint between the roughly hemispherical head of the <span class="bone">humerus</span> and the shallow glenoid fossa of the <span class="bone">scapula</span>.</li>
        <li>It is the most mobile joint in the body and the most frequently dislocated.</li>
        <li>The anatomy of the glenohumeral joint is a compromise between the requirements for motion and stability.</li>
        <li>Motion and stability depend on the surrounding muscular and soft tissue envelope more than on the shape and surface area of the articulating surfaces.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="joint">Joint Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span class="bone-process">humeral head</span> is held to the concave <span class="fossa"> glenoid fossa </span>by the compressive action of the <span class="muscle">rotator cuff muscles</span>.</li>
        <li>The stabilizing mechanism of the glenohumeral joint is one of concavity compression.</li>
        <li>The <span class="muscle">rotator cuff muscles</span> are attached to the proximal <span class="bone">humerus</span> through a <span class="tendon">musculotendinous envelope</span>.</li>
        <li>The deep surface of the <span class="tendon">musculotendinous envelope</span> fuses with the lateral part of the articular <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="bone-process">humeral head</span> is contained in a spherical space bounded medially by the glenoid fossa and elsewhere by the deep surface of the <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="fascia">fibrous capsule</span> acts as a form of osseofibrous acetabulum.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Anatomical Boundaries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The walls of the spherical space containing the glenohumeral joint consist of:</li>
        <ol>

          <li>Coracoid anteriorly</li>
          <li>Coraco-acromial ligament anterosuperiorly</li>
          <li>Acromion and spine of the <span class="bone">scapula</span> posteriorly, posterosuperiorly, and posterolaterally</li>
          <li>Deep surface of deltoid anterolaterally and laterally</li>
        </ol>
        <li>This arrangement creates two gliding planes:</li>
        <ol>
          <span class="plane">


          <li>Internal gliding plane (glenohumeral articular gliding plane)</li>
          <li>External gliding plane (subcoracoid-subacromial-subdeltoid plane)</li>
        </span>
        </ol>
        <li>The external gliding plane is continuous with the plane under the <span class="bone">scapula</span> (scapulothoracic gliding plane).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Gliding and Restrictions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Gliding in the glenohumeral joint is facilitated by the synovial lined cavities of the joint and the <span class="bursae"> subcoracoid, subacromial,</span> and <span class="bursae">subdeltoid bursae</span>.</li>
        <li>Infection, inflammation, and injury can cause adhesions and fibrosis in these gliding planes.</li>
        <li>Adhesions and fibrosis lead to a restriction of motion specific to the site and extent of adhesion.</li>
        <li>The surfaces of the gliding planes are extensive, and fibrosis can be very restricting.</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2 class="articulating-surfaces">Articulating Surfaces</h2>
<p>The articular surfaces are reciprocally curved and are correctly termed ovoids. The surface area of the <span class="bone">humeral</span> convexity is approximately four times that of the <span class="bone">glenoid</span> concavity, which means that only a small portion of the head opposes the glenoid in any position.</p>
<p>The radius of curvature of the glenoid fossa in the coronal plane is greater than that of the humeral head and is deepened by a fibrocartilaginous rim, the <span class="cartilage">glenoid labrum</span>.</p>
<p>Both articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage, thickest centrally and thinner peripherally over the humerus, and vice versa over the glenoid cavity. In most positions, their curvatures are not fully congruent, and the joint is loose-packed; close-packing (full congruence) is probably only reached with the humerus abducted and laterally rotated.</p>

<h2 class="glenoid-labrum">Glenoid Labrum</h2>
<p>The <span class="cartilage">glenoid labrum</span> is a fibrocartilaginous rim around the glenoid fossa. Anteriorly, it is triangular in section; posteriorly, it is more ovoid; while inferiorly, it may be flattened and almost deficient. It varies in size and thickness.</p>
<p>The attachment to the edge of the glenoid fossa is secure superiorly where it blends with the anterior and posterior fasciculi of the long tendon of biceps, less secure posteriorly, but relatively more secure anteroinferiorly. There may be an aperture between the free deep edge of the labrum and the anterior glenoid rim above the midpoint of the fossa.</p>
<p>In slightly less than one-fifth of normal shoulders, there may be no anterior labrum, in which case its place is taken by a cord-like middle glenohumeral ligament. The labrum may be hypoplastic or absent in patients with collagen deficiency but with normal shoulder function (hypermobility syndrome); these shoulders are not necessarily unstable. The labrum deepens the glenoid cavity and may assist in stabilizing the humeral head on the fossa, although the mechanism of this function remains uncertain. It may protect the bone and probably assists lubrication.</p>

<h2 class="fibrous-capsule">Fibrous Capsule</h2>
<p>A fibrous capsule envelops the joint. It is attached medially to the glenoid neck at a variable distance from the glenoid labrum, so forming recesses anterior and posterior to the scapular neck; it includes the supraglenoid tubercle, to which the long head of biceps attaches, and which is therefore intracapsular.</p>
<p>Laterally, it is attached to the anatomical neck of the humerus, i.e., near the articular margin, except inferomedially, where it descends more than 1cm on the calcar humerale. The fibres of the capsule are orientated in a spiral fashion, so that, in elevation of the arm, the capsule tightens, bringing the articular surfaces into closer apposition and contributing to the concavity compression.</p>
<p>In some individuals, a deeper band of fibres orientated in a reverse obliquity to the main capsular fibres passes from the region of the lesser tubercle to the lower part of the anterior rim of the glenoid fossa. This is the anterior oblique band; its contribution to stability is uncertain.</p>
<p>The lateral part of the external surface of the fibrous capsule is blended with the tendons of supraspinatus (superiorly), infraspinatus and teres minor (posteriorly), subscapularis (anteriorly), and by the tendon of the long head of triceps at the infraglenoid tubercle (inferiorly).</p>
<p>The rotator interval is a medially based, triangular area of uncovered capsule between the superior edge of subscapularis and the anterior edge of supraspinatus, with the base of the coracoid as the medial boundary of the interval. It is reinforced by the coracohumeral ligament, the superior glenohumeral ligament, and fibres from the supraspinatus tendon laterally.</p>
<p>The axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral vessels are separated from the inferior capsule by the inferior border of subscapularis. The capsule is least supported inferiorly and subjected to the greatest strain in full abduction when it is stretched tightly across the humeral head. It is supported in this position by the proximal part of the long head of triceps and the broad bulk of teres major.</p>
<p>There are two openings in the capsule: below the coracoid process, connecting the joint cavity to a bursa that may envelop the upper border of the tendon of subscapularis (anteriorly); and between the humeral tubercles, allowing passage of the long tendon of biceps and its synovial sheath.</p>
