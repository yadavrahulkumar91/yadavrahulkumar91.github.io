            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Capacitors are fundamental electronic components used to store and release electrical energy. They are widely employed in various electrical and electronic systems, ranging from simple circuits to advanced devices. Understanding capacitors is crucial for comprehending the principles of energy storage, time-dependent circuits, and numerous applications in electronics. Let's explore capacitors in more detail.

            <h2>Definition and Construction</h2>
            <p>
                A capacitor is a passive two-terminal electronic component that consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. The conductive plates, typically made of metal, accumulate electric charge when a voltage is applied across the terminals of the capacitor. The dielectric material, which can be air, ceramic, plastic, or other insulating materials, prevents direct electrical contact between the plates while allowing the storage of electric potential energy.

            <h2>Capacitance and Capacitor Types</h2>
            <p>
                The capacitance of a capacitor, represented by the symbol C, is a measure of its ability to store electric charge. It is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the charge stored on one plate to the potential difference (voltage) across the plates. Capacitors can have different capacitance values based on their physical characteristics and design. Some common types of capacitors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrolytic Capacitors: These capacitors have a high capacitance and are commonly used in power supply circuits.</li>
                <li>Ceramic Capacitors: Ceramic capacitors have a wide range of capacitance values and find applications in various electronic devices.</li>
                <li>Film Capacitors: Film capacitors are made of an insulating film sandwiched between two conductive layers and are used in applications that require high precision and stability.</li>
                <li>Tantalum Capacitors: Tantalum capacitors offer high capacitance in a small form factor and are often used in portable electronic devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Charging and Discharging</h2>
            <p>
                Capacitors can store electrical energy by charging and release it when discharged. When a voltage is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, it charges by accumulating positive and negative charges on its plates. The time it takes for a capacitor to charge or discharge depends on its capacitance and the resistance in the circuit. Capacitors can be used in various applications, such as timing circuits, energy storage, and smoothing power supplies.
