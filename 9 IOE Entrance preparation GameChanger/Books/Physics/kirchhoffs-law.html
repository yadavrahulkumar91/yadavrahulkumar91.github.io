        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Kirchhoff's Laws are fundamental principles in electrical circuit analysis that help solve complex circuits involving multiple components and branches. They provide a systematic approach for analyzing current and voltage in circuits.</p>
      
        <h2>Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)</h2>
        <p>Kirchhoff's Current Law, also known as KCL, states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a junction) in an electrical circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of currents leaving that node. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p class="math">ΣI<sub>in</sub> = ΣI<sub>out</sub></p>
      
        <h2>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</h2>
        <p>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, also known as KVL, states that the algebraic sum of the voltage drops (or rises) around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p class="math">ΣV = 0</p>
      
        <h2>Application of Kirchhoff's Laws</h2>
        <p>Kirchhoff's Laws are used in various applications for analyzing complex circuits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Circuit Analysis:</b> Kirchhoff's Laws provide a systematic method for analyzing complex circuits with multiple components, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. They help determine the unknown currents and voltages in the circuit.</li>
          <li><b>Mesh Analysis:</b> Kirchhoff's Laws can be applied to solve circuits using mesh analysis, which involves writing Kirchhoff's Voltage Law equations for each closed loop (mesh) in the circuit and solving them simultaneously to find the currents flowing through the loops.</li>
          <li><b>Node Analysis:</b> Kirchhoff's Laws can be used in node analysis, which involves writing Kirchhoff's Current Law equations for each node in the circuit and solving them simultaneously to find the voltages at the nodes.</li>
          <li><b>Bridge Circuits:</b> Kirchhoff's Laws are essential for analyzing bridge circuits, such as Wheatstone bridges and balanced bridge circuits, used for measuring resistance or detecting unknown values.</li>
        </ul>
