            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Electromotive Force (EMF) is a fundamental concept in physics that refers to the driving force that causes electric charges to move in a circuit. Despite its name, EMF is not a force but rather a potential difference or voltage. Understanding EMF is essential for comprehending the behavior of electric circuits, energy conversions, and the functioning of various electrical devices. Let's explore electromotive force in more detail.

            <h2>Definition and Measurement</h2>
            <p>
                Electromotive force (EMF) is defined as the work done per unit charge in moving a charge around a closed circuit. It is measured in volts (V) and represents the potential difference between two points in a circuit when no current is flowing. EMF is responsible for creating an electric field and establishing a potential difference that drives the flow of electric charges, typically electrons, through a circuit.

            <h2>Sources of EMF</h2>
            <p>
                EMF can be generated by various sources, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Batteries: Batteries are common sources of EMF in circuits. They convert chemical energy into electrical energy, providing a potential difference that drives the flow of charges.</li>
                <li>Generators: Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, producing an EMF through electromagnetic induction.</li>
                <li>Solar Cells: Solar cells or photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electrical energy, generating an EMF through the photovoltaic effect.</li>
                <li>Thermoelectric Devices: Thermoelectric devices utilize the Seebeck effect to convert temperature differences into electrical energy, resulting in an EMF.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Internal Resistance</h2>
            <p>
                Real sources of EMF, such as batteries and generators, often have an internal resistance associated with them. This internal resistance limits the maximum current that can be drawn from the source and causes a drop in voltage across the source when a current flows. The relationship between the EMF, the internal resistance, and the external resistance in a circuit is described by Ohm's law and can be used to analyze and calculate circuit behavior.
