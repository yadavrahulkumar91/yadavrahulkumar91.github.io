        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          AC (Alternating Current) circuits play a vital role in the field of electrical engineering. Unlike DC (Direct Current) circuits that have a constant flow of current, AC circuits involve currents that change direction periodically. Understanding AC circuits is crucial for various applications, including power generation, transmission, and distribution. In this section, we will explore the principles, components, and analysis techniques used in AC circuits.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the key concepts related to AC circuits is essential. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alternating Current (AC): AC is an electric current that periodically changes direction with time.</li>
          <li>Frequency: The frequency of an AC circuit represents the number of complete cycles per second and is measured in Hertz (Hz).</li>
          <li>Period: The period of an AC circuit is the time taken to complete one full cycle and is the reciprocal of the frequency.</li>
          <li>Amplitude: The amplitude of an AC current or voltage represents the maximum value reached during each cycle.</li>
          <li>Phase: Phase refers to the relative position of a waveform with respect to a reference waveform.</li>
          <li>Reactance: Reactance is the opposition to the flow of AC current caused by capacitors and inductors in a circuit.</li>
          <li>Impedance: Impedance is the overall opposition to the flow of AC current in a circuit and is the combination of resistance and reactance.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Components in AC Circuits</h2>
        <p>
          AC circuits involve various components that enable the generation, transmission, and utilization of alternating current. These components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AC Generator: AC generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, producing alternating current.</li>
          <li>Resistors: Resistors in AC circuits limit the flow of current and dissipate electrical energy in the form of heat.</li>
          <li>Capacitors: Capacitors store and release electrical energy in AC circuits, causing a phase shift between voltage and current.</li>
          <li>Inductors: Inductors store energy in magnetic fields and create a phase shift between voltage and current in AC circuits.</li>
          <li>Transformers: Transformers are used to step up or step down the voltage in AC circuits for efficient transmission and distribution of power.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Analysis Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Analyzing AC circuits involves various techniques to determine voltage, current, power, and other parameters. Some commonly used techniques include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phasor Diagrams: Phasor diagrams are graphical representations used to analyze the phase relationship between voltage and current in AC circuits.</li>
          <li>Impedance Calculations: Impedance calculations involve determining the overall opposition to current flow in AC circuits, considering both resistive and reactive components.</li>
          <li>Kirchhoff's Laws: Kirchhoff's laws, including Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), are used to analyze complex AC circuits.</li>
          <li>Power Calculations: Power calculations in AC circuits involve determining real power (P), reactive power (Q), and apparent power (S).</li>
          <li>Series and Parallel AC Circuits: The analysis of series and parallel AC circuits is done using techniques similar to those used in DC circuits.</li>
        </ul>
