  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a material when it is exposed to light or other electromagnetic radiation. This effect played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics and provided experimental evidence for the particle-like nature of light. In this section, we will explore the key concepts and experimental observations related to the photoelectric effect.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the key concepts related to the photoelectric effect is essential. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photon: Photons are discrete packets of energy associated with electromagnetic radiation. In the context of the photoelectric effect, photons are considered to behave like particles.</li>
    <li>Threshold Frequency: The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of light required to cause the photoelectric effect. Below this frequency, no electrons are emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light.</li>
    <li>Work Function: The work function of a material is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from its surface. It is a characteristic property of the material.</li>
    <li>Stopping Potential: The stopping potential is the minimum potential difference required to stop the flow of electrons emitted in the photoelectric effect.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Experimental Observations</h2>
  <p>
    The photoelectric effect has been experimentally studied, and several observations have been made:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Immediate Emission: Electrons are emitted from the material's surface immediately after the light or radiation is incident on it, without any noticeable time delay.</li>
    <li>Intensity-Current Relationship: The number of emitted electrons is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. However, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the light.</li>
    <li>Threshold Frequency: There is a minimum frequency of light, known as the threshold frequency, below which no electrons are emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light.</li>
    <li>Energy Conservation: The total energy of the system is conserved in the photoelectric effect. The energy of the incident photons is used to overcome the work function and provide kinetic energy to the emitted electrons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    The photoelectric effect has several practical applications, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photocells: Photocells or photodiodes utilize the photoelectric effect to convert light energy into electrical energy. They are used in various devices, including solar panels, light sensors, and optical communication systems.</li>
    <li>Photoelectric Cells: Photoelectric cells are used in burglar alarms, smoke detectors, and automatic door opening systems, where they detect changes in light intensity caused by objects or individuals.</li>
    <li>Photomultiplier Tubes: Photomultiplier tubes amplify the current produced by the photoelectric effect and are used in applications such as particle detectors, spectroscopy, and imaging devices.</li>
  </ul>
