        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Earth's magnetism refers to the magnetic field generated by the Earth. It plays a crucial role in various natural phenomena and has practical applications in navigation, communication, and scientific research.</p>
      
        <h2>Earth's Magnetic Field</h2>
        <p>The Earth can be considered as a giant magnet with a magnetic field extending from its interior. The magnetic field is believed to be generated by the motion of molten iron in the Earth's outer core. The main features of Earth's magnetic field include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Magnetic North and South Poles:</b> The Earth has magnetic poles, which are slightly offset from the geographic North and South Poles.</li>
          <li><b>Magnetic Field Lines:</b> The magnetic field lines emerge from the magnetic South Pole and enter the magnetic North Pole.</li>
          <li><b>Magnetic Declination:</b> Magnetic declination is the angle between magnetic North and geographic North, which varies depending on the location on Earth.</li>
          <li><b>Magnetic Inclination:</b> Magnetic inclination is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the horizontal plane at a given location.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Magnetic Compass</h2>
        <p>A magnetic compass is a simple instrument that utilizes Earth's magnetism to determine direction. It consists of a magnetized needle that aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic needle points towards the magnetic North Pole, allowing navigation and orientation.</p>
      
        <h2>Applications of Earth's Magnetism</h2>
        <p>Earth's magnetism has several practical applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Navigation:</b> Earth's magnetic field is used for navigation, especially in conjunction with a magnetic compass or electronic navigation systems.</li>
          <li><b>Communication:</b> Long-distance radio communication relies on the propagation of radio waves through the Earth's magnetic field.</li>
          <li><b>Geophysics and Research:</b> Studying Earth's magnetic field provides valuable insights into the Earth's interior, tectonic plate movements, and the behavior of the magnetosphere.</li>
          <li><b>Auroras:</b> Earth's magnetism plays a vital role in the formation of auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) near the poles.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What generates Earth's magnetic field?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by the motion of molten iron in the Earth's outer core.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What is magnetic declination?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Magnetic declination is the angle between magnetic North and geographic North, which varies depending on the location on Earth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: What are some practical applications of Earth's magnetism?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Earth's magnetism is used for navigation, communication, geophysics research, and the formation of auroras.</p>
