        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The gold leaf electroscope is a device used to detect and measure electric charges. It consists of a metal rod with a metal disc at the top and two thin gold leaves attached to the bottom. The gold leaves are extremely lightweight and can be easily deflected by electric charges.</p>
      
        <h2>Working Principle</h2>
        <p>When an electric charge is applied to the metal disc at the top of the electroscope, the charge spreads throughout the metal rod and into the gold leaves. Since like charges repel each other, the gold leaves acquire the same charge and repel each other, causing them to diverge or spread apart.</p>
      
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>The gold leaf electroscope has several applications in physics and electrical experiments, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Charge Detection:</b> It can be used to detect the presence and magnitude of electric charges. When a charged object is brought near the metal disc, the gold leaves will either diverge or converge depending on the charge of the object.</li>
          <li><b>Charge Type Determination:</b> By using a known charge, the electroscope can be used to determine whether an object is positively charged or negatively charged. If the gold leaves diverge, the object has the opposite charge to the known charge. If the gold leaves converge, the object has the same charge as the known charge.</li>
          <li><b>Ionizing Radiation Detection:</b> The electroscope can be used to detect the presence of ionizing radiation such as alpha or beta particles. When ionizing radiation passes through the electroscope, it ionizes the air molecules, causing the gold leaves to diverge.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>The gold leaf electroscope has some limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Sensitivity:</b> The sensitivity of the electroscope depends on the distance between the gold leaves and the metal disc. If the leaves are too close to the disc, they may touch it and discharge, limiting the sensitivity of the device.</li>
          <li><b>Grounding:</b> The electroscope needs to be grounded before use to ensure accurate measurements. Grounding allows any excess charge to flow into the ground, preventing the gold leaves from deflecting due to static charges present in the environment.</li>
        </ul>
