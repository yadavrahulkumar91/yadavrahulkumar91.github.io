            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The heating effect of current, also known as Joule heating or resistive heating, is a phenomenon in which electric current flowing through a conductor produces heat. This effect is widely utilized in various electrical appliances and devices, ranging from electric heaters to toasters. Understanding the heating effect of current is essential for comprehending the behavior of electrical circuits, power dissipation, and the design of electrical heating elements. Let's explore the heating effect of current in more detail.

            <h2>Joule's Law</h2>
            <p>
                The heating effect of current is described by Joule's law, which states that the heat produced in a conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current passing through it, the resistance of the conductor, and the duration of current flow. Mathematically, Joule's law can be expressed as:
            </p>
            <p>
                H = I^2 * R * t
            </p>
            <p>
                Where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>H is the heat generated (in Joules)</li>
                <li>I is the current (in Amperes)</li>
                <li>R is the resistance of the conductor (in Ohms)</li>
                <li>t is the time for which the current flows (in seconds)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Factors Affecting Heating Effect</h2>
            <p>
                Several factors influence the heating effect of current in a conductor, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current: The heat generated is directly proportional to the square of the current. Higher current values result in more heat production.</li>
                <li>Resistance: The heat produced is directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Conductors with higher resistance dissipate more heat.</li>
                <li>Duration: The longer the duration of current flow, the greater the heat generated in the conductor.</li>
                <li>Material: Different materials have different resistivities, which affect their heating properties. Materials with higher resistivity generate more heat for a given current and resistance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>
                The heating effect of current finds numerous applications in various fields, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electric Heating: Electric heaters, water heaters, and cooking appliances utilize the heating effect of current to generate heat for residential and commercial applications.</li>
                <li>Incandescent Lighting: Incandescent light bulbs produce light by passing current through a filament, which heats up and emits light due to the heating effect.</li>
                <li>Electrical Fuses: Fuses are designed to protect electrical circuits by utilizing the heating effect of current. When the current exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse wire heats up and melts, breaking the circuit.</li>
                <li>Electric Welding: Welding processes rely on the heating effect of current to melt and join metal parts together.</li>
            </ul>
