        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Wheatstone Bridge is a circuit configuration used to measure unknown resistances or to determine the ratio of two resistances. It was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in the 19th century.</p>
      
        <h2>Working Principle</h2>
        <p>The Wheatstone Bridge consists of four resistive arms arranged in a diamond shape. It operates based on the principle of balancing the bridge by adjusting the known resistances until the bridge is in a state of equilibrium. The working principle can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A constant current source is connected across the bridge.</li>
          <li>The two opposite vertices of the bridge are connected to a galvanometer.</li>
          <li>An unknown resistance, denoted as R<sub>x</sub>, is connected in one of the arms of the bridge.</li>
          <li>The remaining three arms consist of known resistances, denoted as R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>.</li>
          <li>By adjusting the values of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>, the bridge is balanced when there is no current flow through the galvanometer.</li>
          <li>At balance, the ratio of the known resistances is equal to the ratio of the unknown resistance: R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub> = R<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>x</sub>.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h2>Applications of Wheatstone Bridge</h2>
        <p>The Wheatstone Bridge has several practical applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Resistance Measurement:</b> The Wheatstone Bridge is commonly used to measure the unknown resistance of a component accurately.</li>
          <li><b>Strain Gauge:</b> In strain gauge measurements, a Wheatstone Bridge is used to detect and measure changes in resistance due to mechanical strain.</li>
          <li><b>Temperature Measurement:</b> By utilizing temperature-sensitive resistors, such as thermistors or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), the Wheatstone Bridge can be employed to measure temperature variations.</li>
          <li><b>Load Cell:</b> Load cells, used in weighing scales and force measurement devices, employ Wheatstone Bridges to convert mechanical deformation into electrical signals.</li>
        </ul>
