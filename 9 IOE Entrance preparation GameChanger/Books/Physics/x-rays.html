        <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with high energy and short wavelengths. They were discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1895 and have since found numerous applications in various fields, including medicine, industry, and scientific research.</p>

  <h2>Properties of X-rays</h2>
  <p>X-rays possess the following properties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Electromagnetic Waves:</b> X-rays are electromagnetic waves that have a wavelength shorter than visible light, typically in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers.</li>
    <li><b>Penetrating Power:</b> X-rays have high penetrating power and can pass through many substances, including tissues and various materials.</li>
    <li><b>Ionizing Radiation:</b> X-rays are ionizing radiation, meaning they have sufficient energy to remove electrons from atoms, which can have biological effects.</li>
    <li><b>Photographic and Fluorescent Properties:</b> X-rays can expose photographic film and cause certain substances to fluoresce when exposed to them.</li>
    <li><b>Attenuation:</b> X-rays can be attenuated (weakened) when passing through matter, and the degree of attenuation depends on the material's density and thickness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of X-rays</h2>
  <p>X-rays have a wide range of applications, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Medical Imaging:</b> X-ray imaging, also known as radiography, is widely used in medical diagnostics to visualize internal structures of the body.</li>
    <li><b>Dental Examinations:</b> X-rays are commonly used in dental exams to detect tooth decay, assess oral health, and plan dental treatments.</li>
    <li><b>Security Screening:</b> X-ray scanners are employed at airports and other security checkpoints to detect prohibited items and ensure passenger safety.</li>
    <li><b>Industrial Inspection:</b> X-ray imaging is used for non-destructive testing and inspection of materials, welds, and manufactured components in industries such as aerospace and manufacturing.</li>
    <li><b>Scientific Research:</b> X-rays are utilized in various scientific fields, including materials science, chemistry, and physics, to study the atomic and molecular structure of matter.</li>
  </ul>
