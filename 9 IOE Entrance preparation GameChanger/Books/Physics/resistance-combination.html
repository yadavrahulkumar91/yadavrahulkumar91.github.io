  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Resistance is a fundamental property of electrical components that determines the opposition to the flow of electric current. When multiple resistors are connected in different configurations, their combined resistance can be calculated using specific formulas. Understanding the combination of resistances is crucial in circuit analysis, electrical engineering, and designing practical applications. In this section, we will explore the different types of resistor combinations and how to calculate their total resistance.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the key concepts related to the combination of resistances is essential. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ohm's Law: Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to its resistance (I = V/R).</li>
    <li>Series Combination: In a series combination, resistors are connected end to end, resulting in the total resistance being the sum of individual resistances (R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...).</li>
    <li>Parallel Combination: In a parallel combination, resistors are connected across the same voltage source, resulting in the reciprocal of the total resistance being the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances (1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...).</li>
    <li>Equivalent Resistance: The equivalent resistance represents the total resistance of a combination of resistors and simplifies the analysis of complex circuits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Series Combination</h2>
  <p>
    When resistors are connected in series, their total resistance can be calculated by summing up the individual resistances. The formula for the total resistance in a series combination is:
  </p>
  <p>
    R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...
  </p>

  <h2>Parallel Combination</h2>
  <p>
    When resistors are connected in parallel, their total resistance can be calculated using the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances. The formula for the total resistance in a parallel combination is:
  </p>
  <p>
    1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...
  </p>

  <h2>Examples and Applications</h2>
  <p>
    The combination of resistances has various examples and applications, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Circuit Design: Understanding resistor combinations helps in designing circuits with desired resistance values and current flow.</li>
    <li>Voltage Division: Resistor combinations are used for voltage division applications, such as setting reference voltages or obtaining desired output voltages.</li>
    <li>Current Limiting: Combining resistors is employed to limit the current flowing through different components, protecting them from damage.</li>
    <li>Signal Conditioning: Resistors in various combinations are used for signal conditioning purposes, such as amplification, attenuation, and filtering.</li>
  </ul>
