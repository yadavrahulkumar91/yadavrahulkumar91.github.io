  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electricity that relates the current flowing through a conductor to the voltage across it and the resistance of the conductor. It provides a simple mathematical relationship between these electrical quantities.</p>

  <h2>Statement of Ohm's Law</h2>
  <p>Ohm's Law states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across it and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
  <p class="math">I = V / R</p>

  <h2>Units and Notation</h2>
  <p>In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of current is the Ampere (A), the unit of voltage is the Volt (V), and the unit of resistance is the Ohm (&Omega;). Ohm's Law can also be expressed using the following notation:</p>
  <p class="math">V = I * R</p>
  <p class="math">R = V / I</p>

  <h2>Applications of Ohm's Law</h2>
  <p>Ohm's Law is widely used in various applications in electrical circuits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Circuit Analysis:</b> Ohm's Law allows us to calculate the current flowing through a circuit component or the voltage across it when the resistance is known. It is a fundamental tool for analyzing and designing electrical circuits.</li>
    <li><b>Power Calculation:</b> Ohm's Law can be used to calculate the power dissipated in a resistor. The power (P) can be calculated using the formula:</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="math">P = I<sup>2</sup> * R = V<sup>2</sup> / R</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Voltage Divider:</b> Ohm's Law is used to understand and design voltage divider circuits, which can divide a voltage into smaller values using resistors.</li>
    <li><b>Ohmic Devices:</b> Ohm's Law is applicable to ohmic devices, which are devices that obey Ohm's Law and have a linear relationship between current and voltage. Examples include resistors, certain types of conductors, and some semiconductor devices.</li>
  </ul>
