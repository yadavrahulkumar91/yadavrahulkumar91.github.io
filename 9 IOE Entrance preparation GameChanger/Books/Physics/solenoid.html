        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A solenoid is a long, cylindrical coil of wire that is tightly wound in the form of a helix. It is one of the fundamental components used in electromagnetism and has various applications in physics and engineering. Solenoids produce a magnetic field when an electric current passes through them and exhibit interesting magnetic properties.</p>
      
        <h2>Magnetic Field Inside a Solenoid</h2>
        <p>The magnetic field inside a solenoid is approximately uniform and parallel to the axis of the solenoid. This field can be calculated using Ampere's Law and is given by:</p>
        <p class="math">B = μ₀nI</p>
        <p>where B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current passing through the solenoid.</p>
      
        <h2>Magnetic Field Outside a Solenoid</h2>
        <p>The magnetic field outside a solenoid is relatively weak and resembles the field produced by a bar magnet. The field lines emerge from one end of the solenoid and re-enter through the other end. The field outside the solenoid is negligible compared to the field inside.</p>
      
        <h2>Applications of Solenoids</h2>
        <p>Solenoids have numerous practical applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Electromagnetic Actuators:</b> Solenoids are commonly used as electromagnetic actuators in devices such as door locks, valves, relays, and switches.</li>
          <li><b>Electromagnetic Induction:</b> Solenoids play a vital role in electromagnetic induction experiments and devices, such as transformers and electric generators.</li>
          <li><b>Magnetic Field Generation:</b> Solenoids are used to generate controlled magnetic fields for scientific research, medical applications, and industrial processes.</li>
          <li><b>Particle Accelerators:</b> Solenoids are utilized in particle accelerators to focus and guide charged particles along a specific path.</li>
        </ul>
