        <h1>Conservation of Energy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The principle of conservation of energy is a fundamental concept in physics. It states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. Energy can change from one form to another within the system, but the total amount of energy remains constant.</p>
      
        <h2>Kinds of Energy</h2>
        <p>Energy exists in various forms, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kinetic Energy (KE)</strong>: The energy possessed by an object due to its motion. It is given by the equation:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$\text{Kinetic Energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Potential Energy (PE)</strong>: The energy possessed by an object due to its position or height relative to a reference point. The common forms of potential energy include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>- Gravitational Potential Energy: PE = mass × acceleration due to gravity × height</li>
            <li>- Elastic Potential Energy: PE = (1/2) × spring constant × displacement^2</li>
            <li>- Chemical Potential Energy: Energy stored in chemical bonds</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Conservation of Mechanical Energy</h2>
        <p>In a closed system where only conservative forces (such as gravity and springs) are acting, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) remains constant.</p>
        <p>This principle can be stated as:</p>
        <p>$\text{Initial Kinetic Energy} + \text{Initial Potential Energy} = \text{Final Kinetic Energy} + \text{Final Potential Energy}$</p>
      
        <h2>Work and Energy</h2>
        <p>The work-energy theorem establishes a relationship between work and the change in an object's mechanical energy. It states that:</p>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Change in Kinetic Energy} + \text{Change in Potential Energy}$</p>
      
        <h2>Examples of Conservation of Energy</h2>
        <p>Conservation of energy can be observed in various scenarios. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pendulum swinging back and forth, where potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back.</li>
          <li>A roller coaster moving along its track, where potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and vice versa.</li>
          <li>An object thrown upwards, where kinetic energy is gradually transformed into potential energy as it rises.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What is the principle of conservation of energy?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. Energy can change from one form to another, but the total amount of energy remains constant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What are the different forms of energy?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The different forms of energy include kinetic energy, potential energy (gravitational, elastic, and chemical), thermal energy, and more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: What is mechanical energy?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy in a system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 4: What is the work-energy theorem?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its mechanical energy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 5: How can conservation of energy be observed in daily life?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Conservation of energy can be observed in various situations, such as swinging pendulums, roller coasters, and energy transformations in everyday objects.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 6: Can non-conservative forces change the total mechanical energy of a system?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Yes, non-conservative forces (such as friction) can convert mechanical energy into other forms (e.g., thermal energy), thereby changing the total mechanical energy of a system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 7: How is potential energy related to an object's position?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Potential energy is associated with an object's position or configuration relative to a reference point. It depends on factors like height, spring compression, or chemical composition.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 8: How can the work-energy theorem be applied to calculate the work done?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The work done on an object can be calculated by subtracting the change in its mechanical energy from the work done by non-conservative forces, such as friction.</p>
