            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Radioactivity refers to the spontaneous emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation from the nucleus of an unstable atomic nucleus. This natural phenomenon was discovered by scientists Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The study of radioactivity revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure, led to the development of nuclear physics, and has applications in various fields, including medicine, energy production, and scientific research. Let's explore radioactivity in more detail.

            <h2>Types of Radioactive Decay</h2>
            <p>
                Radioactive decay involves the transformation of one type of nucleus into another through the emission of particles or radiation. There are several types of radioactive decay, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alpha Decay: Alpha decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This process reduces the atomic number by two and the mass number by four.</li>
                <li>Beta Decay: Beta decay involves the emission of beta particles from an unstable nucleus. There are two types of beta decay: beta-minus (β-) decay, where a neutron is transformed into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino, and beta-plus (β+) decay, where a proton is transformed into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino.</li>
                <li>Gamma Decay: Gamma decay is the emission of high-energy photons, called gamma rays, from an excited nucleus. Gamma rays have no charge or mass and are a form of electromagnetic radiation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Radioactive Half-Life</h2>
            <p>
                The radioactive decay of a substance is characterized by its half-life, which is the time it takes for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. Different radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, ranging from fractions of a second to billions of years. The concept of half-life allows scientists to determine the rate of decay, estimate the age of materials, and study the behavior of radioactive substances over time.

            <h2>Radioactive Decay Series</h2>
            <p>
                Some radioactive isotopes undergo a series of decays before reaching a stable nucleus. These are known as radioactive decay series. The most well-known decay series is the Uranium-238 decay series, which includes several intermediate radioactive isotopes such as Thorium-234, Protactinium-234, and Radium-226 before ultimately reaching the stable isotope Lead-206. Each decay in the series occurs with its own characteristic half-life.

            <h2>Applications of Radioactivity</h2>
            <p>
                Radioactivity has numerous practical applications in various fields, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medicine: Radioactive isotopes are used in medical imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and in radiation therapy to treat cancer.</li>
                <li>Energy Production: Nuclear power plants utilize controlled nuclear reactions to generate electricity. The energy released from the fission of radioactive isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, is harnessed to produce heat, which is then converted into electricity.</li>
                <li>Carbon Dating: Radioactive isotopes, such as Carbon-14, are used in carbon dating to determine the age of archaeological artifacts and fossils.</li>
                <li>Industrial Applications: Radioactive isotopes find applications in industry for purposes like testing the integrity of welds, detecting leaks in pipelines, and measuring the thickness of materials.</li>
            </ul>
