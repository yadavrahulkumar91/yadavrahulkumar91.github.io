        <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Gauss's Law is a fundamental principle in physics that relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the net electric charge enclosed by that surface. It provides a powerful method for calculating electric fields and understanding the behavior of electric charges.</p>

  <h2>Statement of Gauss's Law</h2>
  <p>Gauss's Law states that the electric flux (&Phi;) through a closed surface is equal to the net electric charge (Q<sub>enc</sub>) enclosed by that surface divided by the permittivity of free space (&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
  <p class="math">&Phi; = Q<sub>enc</sub> / &epsilon;<sub>0</sub></p>

  <h2>Application of Gauss's Law</h2>
  <p>Gauss's Law has several applications in understanding and calculating electric fields:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Calculating Electric Fields for Symmetric Charge Distributions:</b> Gauss's Law can be used to calculate electric fields for objects with high symmetry, such as uniformly charged spheres, cylinders, or planes. By choosing appropriate Gaussian surfaces and using symmetry arguments, the electric field can be determined easily.</li>
    <li><b>Verifying the Law of Conservation of Electric Charge:</b> Gauss's Law provides a way to verify the law of conservation of electric charge. If the electric flux through a closed surface is zero, it implies that the net charge enclosed by the surface is also zero, which is consistent with the conservation of charge.</li>
    <li><b>Understanding the Behavior of Electric Fields:</b> Gauss's Law helps in understanding how electric fields behave around charged objects. It explains why the electric field inside a conductor is zero in electrostatic equilibrium and how the field lines emanate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges.</li>
  </ul>
