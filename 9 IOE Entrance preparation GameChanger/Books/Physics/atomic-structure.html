  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Bohr's theory of atomic structure, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, revolutionized our understanding of the atom. It provided a theoretical framework that explained the stability of atoms and the emission or absorption of discrete energy levels. Bohr's model laid the foundation for quantum mechanics and played a significant role in the development of modern atomic physics. In this section, we will explore the key concepts and postulates of Bohr's theory of atomic structure.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the key concepts related to Bohr's theory of atomic structure is essential. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantized Energy Levels: According to Bohr, electrons in an atom can exist only in certain specific energy levels or orbits, characterized by discrete energy values.</li>
    <li>Ground State and Excited States: The lowest energy level in an atom is called the ground state, while higher energy levels are referred to as excited states.</li>
    <li>Energy Absorption and Emission: Electrons can absorb or emit energy as they transition between different energy levels, with the emitted or absorbed energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the levels.</li>
    <li>Stationary Orbits: Bohr proposed that electrons revolve around the nucleus in stationary orbits without emitting or absorbing energy.</li>
    <li>Quantum Jump: When an electron transitions between energy levels, it undergoes a quantum jump, emitting or absorbing energy in discrete packets called photons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Postulates of Bohr's Theory</h2>
  <p>
    Bohr's theory is based on several postulates that explain the behavior of electrons in atoms. These postulates include:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Postulate 1: Electrons orbit the nucleus in well-defined circular paths, known as stationary orbits or energy levels.</li>
    <li>Postulate 2: Electrons can exist only in specific energy levels corresponding to quantized energy values.</li>
    <li>Postulate 3: Electrons do not radiate energy while in their stationary orbits, as long as they remain in a particular energy level.</li>
    <li>Postulate 4: Electrons can transition between energy levels by absorbing or emitting energy in discrete quanta.</li>
    <li>Postulate 5: The frequency of radiation emitted or absorbed during an electronic transition is related to the energy difference between the initial and final energy levels by the equation E = hf, where E is the energy difference, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    Bohr's theory of atomic structure has several applications, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spectral Lines: Bohr's theory explains the discrete nature of atomic spectra and the appearance of spectral lines in emission and absorption spectra.</li>
    <li>Atomic Stability: The theory provides a model for the stability of atoms by explaining why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus due to radiation of energy.</li>
    <li>Quantum Mechanics: Bohr's theory served as a precursor to the development of quantum mechanics, which further expanded our understanding of atomic and subatomic phenomena.</li>
  </ul>
