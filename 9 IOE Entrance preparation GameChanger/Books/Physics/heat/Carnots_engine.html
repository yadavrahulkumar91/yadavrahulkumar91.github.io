        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, we will explore Carnot's Engine, a theoretical heat engine that operates on the principles of reversible processes. Carnot's Engine is an idealized model used to understand the maximum efficiency of heat engines and the concept of entropy. We will discuss the key concepts, working principles, and applications of Carnot's Engine.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the key concepts related to Carnot's Engine is crucial. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reversible Processes: Carnot's Engine operates on a series of reversible processes, where the system undergoes infinitesimal changes and can be reversed without leaving any trace.</li>
          <li>Thermal Reservoirs: Carnot's Engine exchanges heat with two thermal reservoirs, one at a high temperature (source) and the other at a low temperature (sink).</li>
          <li>Carnot Cycle: The idealized process of Carnot's Engine consists of four steps: isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression.</li>
          <li>Efficiency: Carnot's Engine provides insight into the maximum efficiency that can be achieved by a heat engine operating between two given temperature reservoirs.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Carnot Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          The Carnot Cycle is a theoretical cycle that Carnot's Engine follows. It consists of the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Isothermal Expansion: The working substance expands while in contact with the high-temperature reservoir, absorbing heat and doing work.</li>
          <li>Adiabatic Expansion: The working substance continues to expand, but without any heat exchange with the surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature and pressure.</li>
          <li>Isothermal Compression: The working substance is compressed while in contact with the low-temperature reservoir, releasing heat and doing work.</li>
          <li>Adiabatic Compression: The working substance continues to compress, but without any heat exchange, resulting in an increase in temperature and pressure.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h2>Efficiency of Carnot's Engine</h2>
        <p>
          The efficiency of Carnot's Engine, denoted by η, is given by the formula:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>η = 1 - (T<sub>cold</sub> / T<sub>hot</sub>)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Where T<sub>cold</sub> is the temperature of the low-temperature reservoir (in Kelvin) and T<sub>hot</sub> is the temperature of the high-temperature reservoir (in Kelvin).
        </p>
      
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Although Carnot's Engine is an idealized model, it has important applications, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understanding Engine Efficiency: Carnot's Engine provides a theoretical upper limit to the efficiency of real heat engines, helping engineers design more efficient engines.</li>
          <li>Thermodynamic Analysis: The principles of Carnot's Engine are used in thermodynamic analyses and the development of thermodynamic cycles for various applications.</li>
          <li>Refrigeration and Heat Pump Systems: The concepts of Carnot's Engine are applied in the design and analysis of refrigeration and heat pump systems.</li>
          <li>Energy Conversion: Understanding Carnot's Engine helps in optimizing energy conversion processes, such as power generation from different energy sources.</li>
        </ul>
