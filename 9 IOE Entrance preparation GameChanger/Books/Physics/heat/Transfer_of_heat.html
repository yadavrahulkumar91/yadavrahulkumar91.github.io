        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Heat transfer is the process of thermal energy moving from one object or substance to another. There are three main mechanisms of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial in various fields, including engineering, meteorology, and everyday life.</p>
      
        <h2>Conduction</h2>
        <p>Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between objects or substances. It occurs when there is a temperature difference between the objects, and the heat flows from the hotter object to the colder one. In solids, conduction is primarily facilitated by the vibration and collision of atoms or molecules. The rate of heat conduction depends on the thermal conductivity of the material and the temperature gradient.</p>
      
        <h2>Convection</h2>
        <p>Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas). It involves the combined effects of conduction and fluid motion. Convection occurs when there is a temperature difference within the fluid, causing warmer portions to rise and cooler portions to sink. This creates a circulation pattern known as convection currents. Convection is responsible for heat transfer in fluids and plays a significant role in processes such as atmospheric circulation and ocean currents.</p>
      
        <h2>Radiation</h2>
        <p>Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves. Unlike conduction and convection, radiation does not require a medium to transfer heat. It can occur in a vacuum or through transparent substances. All objects emit thermal radiation, which is governed by their temperature. The rate of radiation depends on factors such as the surface area, emissivity, and temperature difference between objects. Examples of radiation include the heat transfer from the Sun to the Earth and the emission of infrared radiation from a hot object.</p>
      
        <h2>Applications and Examples</h2>
        <p>The understanding of heat transfer mechanisms is vital in various applications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thermal insulation: Knowledge of conduction helps in designing materials with low thermal conductivity to minimize heat transfer.</li>
          <li>Heating and cooling systems: Convection plays a role in the movement of air or fluid to distribute heat or coldness in a space.</li>
          <li>Solar energy: Radiation from the Sun is harnessed for heating, electricity generation, and other renewable energy applications.</li>
          <li>Thermal imaging: The detection of infrared radiation is used for non-contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging technology.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: How does convection occur?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Convection occurs when there is a temperature difference within a fluid, causing warmer portions to rise and cooler portions to sink, creating convection currents.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: What is radiation?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, without the need for a medium.</p>
