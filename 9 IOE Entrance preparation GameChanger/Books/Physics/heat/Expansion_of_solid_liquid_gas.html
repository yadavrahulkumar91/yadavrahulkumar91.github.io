        <h1>Expansion of Solid, Liquid, and Gas</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, we will explore the expansion of solid, liquid, and gas. When substances are subjected to changes in temperature, they undergo expansion or contraction. Understanding the behavior of solids, liquids, and gases during thermal expansion is essential in various fields, including engineering, construction, and materials science. We will discuss the concepts, mechanisms, and applications of expansion in different states of matter.

        <h2>Expansion of Solids</h2>
        <p>
          Solids expand when heated and contract when cooled. The expansion of solids can be described by the coefficient of linear expansion, which quantifies the change in length per unit length per degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature. Some key points to explore include:

        <ul>
          <li>Coefficient of Linear Expansion: Definition and measurement.</li>
          <li>Applications of Expansion in Solids: Consideration in building structures, bridges, and railways.</li>
          <li>Thermal Stress: Consequences and mitigation measures.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Expansion of Liquids</h2>
        <p>
          Liquids also expand when heated but at a greater rate compared to solids. Unlike solids, the expansion of liquids is isotropic, meaning it occurs uniformly in all directions. Some key points to explore include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coefficient of Volume Expansion: Definition and measurement.</li>
          <li>Applications of Expansion in Liquids: Consideration in thermometers, hydrometers, and plumbing systems.</li>
          <li>Anomalous Expansion of Water: Explanation and significance.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Expansion of Gases</h2>
        <p>
          Gases exhibit the greatest expansion compared to solids and liquids. The expansion of gases follows Charles's Law, which states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature at constant pressure. Some key points to explore include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coefficient of Cubical Expansion: Definition and calculation.</li>
          <li>Applications of Expansion in Gases: Consideration in gas turbines, internal combustion engines, and HVAC systems.</li>
          <li>Gas Laws: Introduction to Boyle's Law and Gay-Lussac's Law.</li>
        </ul>
