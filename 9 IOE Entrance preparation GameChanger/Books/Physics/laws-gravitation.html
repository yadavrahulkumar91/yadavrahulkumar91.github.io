        <h1>Laws of Gravitation</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, we will study the fundamental laws of gravitation that describe the interactions between objects with mass. These laws were first formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century and have since been widely accepted in the field of physics.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>
        <p>
          The law of universal gravitation states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
        </p>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>$F$ is the gravitational force between two objects</li>
          <li>$G$ is the gravitational constant</li>
          <li>$m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects</li>
          <li>$r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Gravitational Field</h2>
        <p>
          The gravitational field is a concept that helps us understand how the presence of a massive object affects the space around it. It is defined as the force experienced by a unit mass placed at a particular point in space. The gravitational field intensity, denoted by $$\vec{g}$$, is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$\vec{g} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}$$
        </p>
        <p>
          Where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>$\vec{F}$ is the gravitational force acting on the unit mass</li>
          <li>$m$ is the mass of the unit mass</li>
        </ul>
