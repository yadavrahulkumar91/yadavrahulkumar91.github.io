            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Ampere's Law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. It provides a convenient way to calculate the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying conductor or a group of conductors. Ampere's Law, along with other laws and principles, forms the basis of electromagnetism and has applications in various fields such as electrical engineering, physics, and technology. Let's explore Ampere's Law in more detail.

            <h2>Statement of Ampere's Law</h2>
            <p>
                Ampere's Law states that the line integral of the magnetic field, B, around a closed loop, C, is equal to the product of the permeability of free space, μ₀, and the total current passing through the surface bounded by the loop:
            </p>
            <p class="equation">
                ∮<sub>C</sub> B · dl = μ₀I<sub>enc</sub>
            </p>
            <p>
                where B is the magnetic field, dl is an infinitesimal element along the loop C, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (approximately 4π × 10⁻⁷ Tm/A), and I<sub>enc</sub> is the total enclosed current. The integral on the left-hand side is known as the line integral of B along C.

            <h2>Application of Ampere's Law</h2>
            <p>
                Ampere's Law can be applied to calculate the magnetic field produced by various current configurations, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Straight Current-Carrying Conductor: For an infinitely long, straight conductor with a steady current, Ampere's Law allows us to determine the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field at different distances from the conductor. The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the conductor.</li>
                <li>Current Loop: For a closed loop carrying current, Ampere's Law helps in determining the magnetic field at different points inside and outside the loop. The magnetic field lines follow a circular path around the loop.</li>
                <li>Solenoid: Ampere's Law can be used to calculate the magnetic field inside and outside a long, tightly wound solenoid carrying current. The magnetic field lines are parallel to the axis of the solenoid and exhibit a uniform pattern.</li>
                <li>Toroid: Ampere's Law is applicable to determine the magnetic field inside and outside a toroid, which is a doughnut-shaped coil carrying current. The magnetic field lines are confined to the core of the toroid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitations and Assumptions</h2>
            <p>
                Ampere's Law is based on a few assumptions and has certain limitations, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ampere's Law assumes that the current is steady and does not change with time.</li>
                <li>It assumes that the magnetic field produced by the current is not time-dependent.</li>
                <li>Ampere's Law is valid for situations where the dimensions of the conductors are much smaller than the distance over which the magnetic field is being calculated.</li>
                <li>It assumes that there are no sources or sinks of magnetic field within the loop.</li>
            </ul>
