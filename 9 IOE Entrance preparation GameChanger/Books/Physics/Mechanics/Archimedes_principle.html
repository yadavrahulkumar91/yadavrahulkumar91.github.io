  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Archimedes' principle is a fundamental concept in physics that explains the buoyant force experienced by an object submerged in a fluid. It states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. This principle was discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist Archimedes.</p>

  <h2>Statement of Archimedes' Principle</h2>
  <p>Archimedes' principle can be stated as follows:</p>
  <p>"Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."</p>

  <h2>Buoyant Force</h2>
  <p>The buoyant force is the upward force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid. It is caused by the difference in pressure between the top and bottom of the object due to the weight of the fluid above it.</p>
  <p>The magnitude of the buoyant force can be calculated using the formula:</p>
  <p>$F_{\text{buoy}} = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \times g \times V_{\text{displaced}}$</p>
  <p>where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$F_{\text{buoy}}$ is the buoyant force</li>
    <li>$\rho_{\text{fluid}}$ is the density of the fluid</li>
    <li>$g$ is the acceleration due to gravity</li>
    <li>$V_{\text{displaced}}$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Archimedes' Principle</h2>
  <p>Archimedes' principle has several practical applications, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the buoyancy of objects in water, such as ships, submarines, and floating objects</li>
    <li>Explaining why objects appear lighter when submerged in water</li>
    <li>Designing and operating submarines, hot air balloons, and flotation devices</li>
    <li>Measuring the density of irregularly shaped objects using a water displacement method</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of Archimedes' principle:</p>
  <p>Example: A solid sphere with a volume of 0.1 m³ and a density of 500 kg/m³ is submerged in water. Calculate the buoyant force acting on the sphere.</p>
  <p>Using Archimedes' principle and the formula for buoyant force:</p>
  <p>$F_{\text{buoy}} = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \times g \times V_{\text{displaced}}$</p>
  <p>The density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³, and the volume of the water displaced by the sphere is 0.1 m³ (equal to the volume of the sphere).</p>
  <p>Substituting the values:</p>
  <p>$F_{\text{buoy}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m³} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s²} \times 0.1 \, \text{m³} = 980 \, \text{N}$</p>
  <p>Therefore, the buoyant force acting on the sphere is 980 N.</p>
