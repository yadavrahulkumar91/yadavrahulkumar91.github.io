        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hooke's Law is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between the force applied to a spring and the resulting displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. It is named after the 17th-century physicist Robert Hooke.</p>
      
        <h2>Statement of Hooke's Law</h2>
        <p>Hooke's Law can be stated as follows:</p>
        <p>"The force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position, as long as the spring does not exceed its elastic limit."</p>
      
        <h2>Mathematical Formulation</h2>
        <p>Hooke's Law can be mathematically expressed as:</p>
        <p>$F = -kx$</p>
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$F$ is the force applied to the spring</li>
          <li>$k$ is the spring constant, a measure of the stiffness of the spring</li>
          <li>$x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Spring Constant</h2>
        <p>The spring constant ($k$) determines the stiffness of a spring. It represents the amount of force required to stretch or compress the spring by a certain amount. Springs with higher spring constants are stiffer and require more force to produce the same displacement compared to springs with lower spring constants.</p>
      
        <h2>Applications of Hooke's Law</h2>
        <p>Hooke's Law has various applications in different fields, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring systems, such as in suspension systems and mattresses</li>
          <li>Elastic materials, such as rubber bands and bungee cords</li>
          <li>Force measurement devices, such as strain gauges and load cells</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of Hooke's Law:</p>
        <p>Example: A spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m is stretched by 0.2 meters. Calculate the force exerted by the spring.</p>
        <p>Using Hooke's Law formula:</p>
        <p>$F = -kx$</p>
        <p>Substituting the given values:</p>
        <p>$F = -100 \, \text{N/m} \times 0.2 \, \text{m} = -20 \, \text{N}$</p>
        <p>Therefore, the force exerted by the spring is 20 N.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What is Hooke's Law?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Hooke's Law describes the relationship between the force applied to a spring and the resulting displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What is the mathematical formulation of Hooke's Law?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The mathematical formulation of Hooke's Law is $F = -kx$, where $F$ is the force applied to the spring, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.</p>
