        <h1>Work, Power, and Energy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Work, power, and energy are fundamental concepts in physics that describe the transfer and transformation of energy in various systems. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing the motion and interactions of objects.</p>
      
        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>In physics, work is defined as the product of the force applied on an object and the displacement of the object in the direction of the force. Mathematically, it is given by the equation:</p>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Displacement} \times \cos(\theta)$</p>
        <p>where $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.</p>
      
        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is defined as the work done per unit time. Mathematically, power is given by the equation:</p>
        <p>$\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}}$</p>
        <p>Alternatively, power can be calculated as the product of force and velocity:</p>
        <p>$\text{Power} = \text{Force} \times \text{Velocity}$</p>
      
        <h2>Energy</h2>
        <p>Energy is the ability of an object or system to do work. It exists in various forms, including kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy. The total energy of a system is conserved, although it can be transformed from one form to another. The most common forms of energy encountered in physics are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kinetic Energy</strong>: The energy possessed by an object due to its motion. It is given by the equation:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$\text{Kinetic Energy} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}^2$</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Potential Energy</strong>: The energy possessed by an object due to its position or height relative to a reference point. It depends on the object's mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$\text{Potential Energy} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration due to gravity} \times \text{height}$</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Work-Energy Theorem</strong>: The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Change in Kinetic Energy}$</p>
      
        <h2>Formulas and Tricks</h2>
        <p>Here are some formulas and tricks related to work, power, and energy:</p>
      
        <h3>1. Work Done by a Constant Force</h3>
        <p>If the force acting on an object is constant, the work done can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Displacement} \times \cos(\theta)$</p>
        <p>where $\theta$ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.</p>
      
        <h3>2. Work Done by a Variable Force</h3>
        <p>If the force acting on an object is not constant, the work done can be calculated by integrating the product of force and displacement over the given path.</p>
      
        <h3>3. Calculating Power</h3>
        <p>The power can be calculated using the formulas:</p>
        <p>$\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}}$</p>
        <p>$\text{Power} = \text{Force} \times \text{Velocity}$</p>
      
        <h3>4. Relationship between Work and Energy</h3>
        <p>The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. This principle is known as the work-energy theorem and is mathematically represented as:</p>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Change in Kinetic Energy}$</p>
      
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of work, power, and energy:</p>
        <p>Example: A person pushes a box with a force of 50 N over a distance of 10 m. If it takes 5 seconds to move the box, calculate the work done, the power exerted, and the change in kinetic energy of the box.</p>
        <p>The work done can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>$\text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Displacement} \times \cos(\theta)$</p>
        <p>The power exerted can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>$\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}}$</p>
        <p>The change in kinetic energy can be calculated using the work-energy theorem:</p>
        <p>$\text{Change in Kinetic Energy} = \text{Work}$</p>
