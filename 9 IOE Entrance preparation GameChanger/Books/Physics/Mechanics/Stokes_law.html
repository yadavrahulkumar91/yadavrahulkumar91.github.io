  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Stokes' law is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that describes the motion of small particles through a viscous fluid. It was derived by the Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes and is particularly applicable to particles that have a negligible effect on the fluid flow.</p>

  <h2>Statement of Stokes' Law</h2>
  <p>Stokes' law states that the drag force experienced by a small spherical particle moving through a viscous fluid is directly proportional to its velocity and the viscosity of the fluid, and is also dependent on the radius of the particle.</p>
  
  <p>The mathematical expression for the drag force can be written as:</p>
  <p>$F_d = 6 \pi \eta r v$</p>
  <p>where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$F_d$ is the drag force</li>
    <li>$\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid</li>
    <li>$r$ is the radius of the particle</li>
    <li>$v$ is the velocity of the particle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Stokes' Law</h2>
  <p>Stokes' law has several practical applications, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the settling of small particles in a fluid, such as sedimentation processes</li>
    <li>Estimating the size and properties of colloidal particles and emulsions</li>
    <li>Calculating the terminal velocity of small particles falling through a fluid</li>
    <li>Characterizing the behavior of particles in microfluidic systems and lab-on-a-chip devices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of Stokes' law:</p>
  <p>Example: A small spherical particle with a radius of 0.001 meters is moving through a fluid with a viscosity of 0.01 Pa·s. If the velocity of the particle is 0.1 m/s, calculate the drag force acting on the particle.</p>
  <p>Using Stokes' law and the formula for drag force:</p>
  <p>$F_d = 6 \pi \eta r v$</p>
  <p>Substituting the given values:</p>
  <p>$F_d = 6 \pi \times 0.01 \, \text{Pa·s} \times 0.001 \, \text{m} \times 0.1 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.00188 \, \text{N}$</p>
  <p>Therefore, the drag force acting on the particle is approximately 0.00188 N.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Question 1: What is Stokes' law?</h3>
      <p>Answer: Stokes' law describes the motion of small particles through a viscous fluid and relates the drag force experienced by the particle to its velocity, viscosity of the fluid, and the particle's radius.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Question 2: How is the drag force calculated in Stokes' law?</h3>
      <p>Answer: The drag force ($F_d$) is calculated using the formula $F_d = 6 \pi \eta r v$, where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, $r$ is the radius of the particle, and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.</p>
