  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    When an electric current passes through a conductor, it experiences a force due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the moving charges. This phenomenon, known as the force on a current carrying conductor, is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism. Understanding this force is crucial for various applications, such as electric motors, generators, and magnetic levitation systems. In this section, we will explore the principles, calculations, and applications of the force on a current carrying conductor.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the key concepts related to the force on a current carrying conductor is essential. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Magnetic Field: A magnetic field is produced around a current carrying conductor, and it interacts with the external magnetic field to create a force.</li>
    <li>Right-Hand Rule: The direction of the force can be determined using the right-hand rule, where the thumb points in the direction of the current, and the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field.</li>
    <li>Current Direction: The force on a conductor depends on the direction of the current relative to the magnetic field.</li>
    <li>Conductor Length: The longer the conductor, the greater the force experienced.</li>
    <li>Magnetic Field Strength: The stronger the magnetic field, the greater the force exerted on the current carrying conductor.</li>
    <li>Current Magnitude: The force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current flowing through the conductor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Calculation of Force</h2>
  <p>
    The force experienced by a current carrying conductor can be calculated using the formula:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    F = BIL sinθ
  </p>
  <p>
    where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>F is the force on the conductor (in Newtons).</li>
    <li>B is the magnetic field strength (in Tesla).</li>
    <li>I is the current flowing through the conductor (in Amperes).</li>
    <li>L is the length of the conductor (in meters).</li>
    <li>θ is the angle between the direction of the current and the magnetic field.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    The force on a current carrying conductor has various practical applications, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Electric Motors: Electric motors utilize the force on a current carrying conductor to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.</li>
    <li>Electromagnetic Brakes: The force is used in electromagnetic brakes to generate a braking effect by applying a magnetic field to a conductor.</li>
    <li>Magnetic Levitation: Magnetic levitation systems, such as maglev trains, use the force to suspend and propel vehicles without physical contact with the track.</li>
    <li>Galvanometers: Galvanometers employ the force on a current carrying coil to measure and display electrical currents.</li>
    <li>Loudspeakers: The force on a current carrying coil is utilized in loudspeakers to convert electrical signals into sound waves.</li>
  </ul>
