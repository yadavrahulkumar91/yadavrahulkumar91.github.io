        <h1>Center of Mass and Center of Gravity</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The center of mass and center of gravity are concepts used to describe the distribution of mass in an object and its overall balance. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing the stability, equilibrium, and motion of objects.</p>
      
        <h2>Center of Mass</h2>
        <p>The center of mass (COM) of an object is the point at which the entire mass of the object can be considered to be concentrated. It is the average position of all the individual particles of mass that make up the object.</p>
        <p>The center of mass can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
        <p>$\text{COM} = \frac{\sum m_i \cdot \vec{r}_i}{\sum m_i}$</p>
        <p>where $\text{COM}$ is the center of mass, $m_i$ is the mass of each individual particle, and $\vec{r}_i$ is the position vector of each particle with respect to a chosen reference point.</p>
      
        <h2>Center of Gravity</h2>
        <p>The center of gravity (COG) of an object is the point where the entire weight of the object can be considered to act. It is the point at which the gravitational force on the object can be assumed to be concentrated.</p>
        <p>In a uniform gravitational field, the center of gravity coincides with the center of mass. However, in cases where the gravitational field is not uniform, such as near Earth's surface, the center of gravity may not coincide with the center of mass.</p>
      
        <h2>Tricks and Tips</h2>
        <p>Here are some tricks and tips related to the center of mass and center of gravity:</p>
      
        <h3>1. Symmetry</h3>
        <p>If an object has a symmetrical shape, its center of mass will be located at the geometric center of the object. For example, a uniform rectangular plate will have its center of mass at the midpoint of its diagonal.</p>
      
        <h3>2. Center of Gravity in Regular Objects</h3>
        <p>In regular objects with uniform density, the center of gravity is located at the geometric center of the object. For example, in a symmetrical sphere or a uniform rectangular block, the center of gravity is at the center of the object.</p>
      
        <h3>3. Center of Gravity in Irregular Objects</h3>
        <p>In irregular objects, finding the center of gravity may require more complex calculations. One method is to hang the object from different points and observe where it balances. The point of balance corresponds to the center of gravity.</p>
      
        <h3>4. Stability and Center of Gravity</h3>
        <p>The stability of an object depends on the position of its center of gravity. If the center of gravity is above the base of support, the object is stable. If the center of gravity is outside the base of support, the object becomes unstable and may topple over.</p>
      
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of center of mass and center of gravity:</p>
        <p>Example: A thin, uniform rod of length 2 meters has a mass of 4 kg. Determine the position of the center of mass and center of gravity.</p>
        <p>The center of mass of a uniform rod is located at its midpoint. Therefore, the center of mass is at a distance of 1 meter from one end of the rod.</p>
        <p>The center of gravity of the rod will coincide with the center of mass if the gravitational field is uniform.</p>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What is the difference between center of mass and center of gravity?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The center of mass is the point at which the entire mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated, while the center of gravity is the point where the entire weight of the object can be considered to act. In a uniform gravitational field, the center of gravity coincides with the center of mass.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: How can you determine the center of gravity of an irregular object?</h3>
            <p>Answer: One method to determine the center of gravity of an irregular object is by suspending the object from different points and observing where it balances. The point of balance corresponds to the center of gravity.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: How does the position of the center of gravity affect the stability of an object?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The stability of an object depends on the position of its center of gravity. If the center of gravity is above the base of support, the object is stable. If the center of gravity is outside the base of support, the object becomes unstable and may topple over.</p>
