        <h1>Surface Tension and Capillarity</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter, we will explore the concepts of surface tension and capillarity. Surface tension refers to the attractive force experienced by the molecules at the surface of a liquid, causing the surface to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. Capillarity, on the other hand, describes the phenomenon of liquid rising or falling in a narrow tube due to the combined effects of adhesion and cohesion forces.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Surface Tension</h2>
        <p>
          Surface tension arises due to the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules. It is defined as the force per unit length acting parallel to the surface of the liquid. Mathematically, surface tension can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$\gamma = \frac{F}{l}$$
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>$$\gamma$$ is the surface tension</li>
          <li>$$F$$ is the force acting parallel to the surface</li>
          <li>$$l$$ is the length over which the force acts</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Capillarity</h2>
        <p>
          Capillarity is the phenomenon of liquid rising or falling in a narrow tube, known as a capillary tube. The rise or fall of the liquid depends on the relative strength of adhesive and cohesive forces. If the adhesive forces between the liquid and the tube wall are stronger than the cohesive forces within the liquid, the liquid rises in the tube, forming a meniscus. Conversely, if the cohesive forces are stronger, the liquid may fall in the tube.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Mathematical Expression for Capillary Rise</h2>
        <p>
          The height $$h$$ to which a liquid rises in a capillary tube can be calculated using the following equation:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$h = \frac{{2\gamma\cos(\theta)}}{{\rho gr}}$$
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>$$h$$ is the height of capillary rise</li>
          <li>$$\gamma$$ is the surface tension of the liquid</li>
          <li>$$\theta$$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube wall</li>
          <li>$$\rho$$ is the density of the liquid</li>
          <li>$$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity</li>
          <li>$$r$$ is the radius of the capillary tube</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Surface tension is responsible for the formation of droplets, dew on leaves, and the shape of water droplets on surfaces.</li>
          <li>Capillarity is observed in the upward movement of water in plants, called capillary action, facilitating the transport of water and nutrients.</li>
          <li>Capillary action is also used in capillary tubes of medical devices, such as blood glucose meters, to draw a small blood sample for analysis.</li>
          <li>The rise of oil in a wick of an oil lamp is another example of capillary action.</li>
        </ul>
