        <h1>Angular Speed</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In physics, angular speed refers to the rate at which an object rotates or revolves around a fixed axis. It is a measure of how quickly an object changes its angular position.</p>

  <h2>Angular Speed Formula</h2>
  <p>Angular speed ($\omega$) is calculated by dividing the change in angle ($\Delta\theta$) by the change in time ($\Delta t$). The formula for angular speed is:</p>
  <p>$\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}$</p>

  <h2>Units of Angular Speed</h2>
  <p>The SI unit of angular speed is radians per second (rad/s). However, other common units include degrees per second (°/s) and revolutions per minute (rpm).</p>

  <h2>Relationship between Linear and Angular Speed</h2>
  <p>Linear speed ($v$) is the linear distance traveled per unit of time. It is related to angular speed ($\omega$) through the equation:</p>
  <p>$v = r \times \omega$</p>
  <p>where $r$ is the distance from the object to the axis of rotation.</p>

  <h2>Angular Speed and Period</h2>
  <p>The period ($T$) of an object's rotation is the time it takes to complete one full revolution. The relationship between angular speed and period is given by:</p>
  <p>$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of angular speed:</p>
  <p>Example: A wheel completes 10 revolutions in 5 seconds. Calculate the angular speed of the wheel in radians per second and degrees per second.</p>
  <p>The angular speed can be calculated using the formula:</p>
  <p>$\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}$</p>
  <p>To convert the revolutions to radians, we multiply by $2\pi$ since 1 revolution = $2\pi$ radians. To convert to degrees, we multiply by 360 since 1 revolution = 360 degrees.</p>
