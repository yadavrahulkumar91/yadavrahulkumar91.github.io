  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The chemical effect of current refers to the phenomenon where an electric current flowing through an electrolyte causes chemical reactions to occur. This effect plays a crucial role in various electrochemical processes and practical applications.</p>

  <h2>Electrolysis</h2>
  <p>Electrolysis is the process of using an electric current to bring about a chemical reaction. It involves the decomposition of an electrolyte into its constituent elements or ions. The key components involved in electrolysis are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Electrolyte:</b> An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity when dissolved in a solvent or when molten. It can be an ionic compound or a solution containing ions.</li>
    <li><b>Anode:</b> The anode is the positive electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) occurs. It attracts anions (negative ions) from the electrolyte.</li>
    <li><b>Cathode:</b> The cathode is the negative electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) occurs. It attracts cations (positive ions) from the electrolyte.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis</h2>
  <p>Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis, formulated by Michael Faraday, describe the quantitative relationship between the amount of substance undergoing electrolysis and the electric current passing through the electrolyte. These laws are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>First Law:</b> The mass of a substance deposited or liberated at an electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte.</li>
    <li><b>Second Law:</b> The mass of different substances deposited or liberated by the same quantity of electricity is proportional to their respective chemical equivalent weights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Chemical Effect of Current</h2>
  <p>The chemical effect of current finds practical applications in various fields:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Electroplating:</b> Electroplating is the process of depositing a thin layer of metal onto the surface of an object using electrolysis. It is used for decorative purposes, protection against corrosion, and improving conductivity.</li>
    <li><b>Electrorefining:</b> Electrorefining is used to purify metals by electrolysis. Impure metal is used as the anode, and a pure metal is deposited at the cathode.</li>
    <li><b>Electrolytic Cells:</b> Electrolytic cells are used in industries for the production of chemicals, such as chlorine and sodium hydroxide in the chlor-alkali industry.</li>
    <li><b>Electrolysis in Biology:</b> Electrolysis plays a role in biological systems, such as nerve transmission and muscle contractions, which involve the movement of ions across cell membranes.</li>
  </ul>
