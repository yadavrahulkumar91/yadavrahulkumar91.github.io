        <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Cathode rays are streams of electrons that are emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) of a high-vacuum discharge tube. They were first discovered and studied by J.J. Thomson in the late 19th century, and their properties played a significant role in the development of modern physics.</p>

  <h2>Properties of Cathode Rays</h2>
  <p>Cathode rays exhibit several interesting properties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Nature:</b> Cathode rays consist of negatively charged particles called electrons.</li>
    <li><b>Charge-to-Mass Ratio:</b> Cathode rays have a specific charge-to-mass ratio, which was determined by Thomson to be e/m = -1.76 × 10^8 C/kg.</li>
    <li><b>Deflection in Electric and Magnetic Fields:</b> Cathode rays can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields, indicating their charged nature.</li>
    <li><b>Particle-like Behavior:</b> Cathode rays travel in straight lines, collide with objects in their path, and produce shadow images.</li>
    <li><b>Heat and Luminescence:</b> When cathode rays strike a material, they can generate heat and cause certain substances to emit light (phosphorescence).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications of Cathode Rays</h2>
  <p>Cathode rays have found applications in various areas, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs):</b> Cathode ray tubes have been used in early television sets and computer monitors to display images.</li>
    <li><b>Particle Accelerators:</b> Cathode rays, specifically electrons, are utilized in particle accelerators for research in nuclear and particle physics.</li>
    <li><b>Cathode Ray Oscilloscopes (CROs):</b> CROs are electronic devices that utilize cathode rays to display and analyze electrical waveforms.</li>
    <li><b>X-ray Production:</b> When cathode rays strike a metal target, they can generate X-rays, which have various applications in medicine and industry.</li>
  </ul>
