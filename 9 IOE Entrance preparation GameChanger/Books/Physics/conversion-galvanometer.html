        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Galvanometers are sensitive instruments used to detect and measure small electric currents. However, they can be converted into voltmeters and ammeters, which are instruments used to measure voltage and current, respectively, in a wider range of values. The conversion of a galvanometer into a voltmeter or ammeter involves adding external components to modify the sensitivity and range of the galvanometer. Understanding these conversion techniques is essential for using galvanometers effectively in various electrical and electronic applications. Let's explore the conversion of a galvanometer into a voltmeter and ammeter in more detail.

        <h2>Conversion into Voltmeter</h2>
        <p>
            To convert a galvanometer into a voltmeter, a high resistance known as a "shunt" resistor is connected in parallel with the galvanometer. The shunt resistor provides a bypass path for most of the current, allowing only a small fraction of the current to pass through the galvanometer. By choosing the appropriate resistance value for the shunt, the voltmeter can be calibrated to measure a specific voltage range. The relationship between the shunt resistance, the galvanometer resistance, and the desired voltage range is determined by Ohm's law.

        <h2>Conversion into Ammeter</h2>
        <p>
            To convert a galvanometer into an ammeter, a low resistance known as a "current-sensing resistor" or "shunt resistor" is connected in series with the galvanometer. The current-sensing resistor allows a known fraction of the total current to flow through the galvanometer, which is used to measure the current. The resistance value of the current-sensing resistor is carefully selected based on the desired current range and the galvanometer's sensitivity. The relationship between the current-sensing resistor, the galvanometer resistance, and the desired current range is determined by Ohm's law.

        <h2>Calibration and Range</h2>
        <p>
            Calibration is a critical step in converting a galvanometer into a voltmeter or ammeter. It involves determining the appropriate resistance values for the shunt resistor (for voltmeter conversion) or current-sensing resistor (for ammeter conversion) to achieve accurate measurements. The resistance values are chosen based on the desired voltage or current range and the sensitivity of the galvanometer. Calibration may involve adjusting the resistance values or adding multiple shunt resistors in parallel or current-sensing resistors in series to achieve different measurement ranges.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The conversion of galvanometers into voltmeters and ammeters allows for the measurement of voltage and current in a wider range of values. By adding external components such as shunt resistors or current-sensing resistors, the sensitivity and range of the galvanometer can be modified. Calibration is necessary to achieve accurate measurements, and the resistance values are chosen based on the desired voltage or current range and the galvanometer's sensitivity. Converted voltmeters and ammeters find applications in electrical circuits, electronics, power systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems. Understanding the conversion techniques is crucial for utilizing galvanometers effectively in various practical scenarios.
