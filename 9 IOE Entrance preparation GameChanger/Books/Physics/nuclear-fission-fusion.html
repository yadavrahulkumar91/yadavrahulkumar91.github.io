        <h2>Fission</h2>
        <p>Fission is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, along with the release of a large amount of energy. This process is typically achieved by bombarding a heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, with a neutron. The fission process releases additional neutrons, which can cause a chain reaction if they are absorbed by other fissile nuclei.</p>
      
        <h3>Key Points about Fission:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fission is accompanied by the release of a tremendous amount of energy.</li>
          <li>The energy released is in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the energy carried by the emitted neutrons.</li>
          <li>Fission can be controlled to generate a steady release of energy in nuclear power plants, where the heat produced is used to generate steam and drive turbines.</li>
          <li>Uncontrolled fission reactions can lead to nuclear explosions, such as those in atomic bombs.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Fusion</h2>
        <p>Fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, accompanied by the release of a large amount of energy. Fusion reactions require extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei. The fusion process occurs naturally in the core of stars, including our Sun.</p>
      
        <h3>Key Points about Fusion:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fusion is the process that powers the Sun and other stars, where hydrogen nuclei combine to form helium nuclei, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process.</li>
          <li>Fusion reactions have the potential to produce an almost limitless supply of clean energy, as they utilize abundant fuel sources like hydrogen isotopes.</li>
          <li>However, achieving controlled fusion reactions on Earth is challenging due to the high temperatures and pressures required, as well as the containment of the plasma.</li>
          <li>Research into controlled fusion, such as magnetic confinement fusion (e.g., tokamaks) and inertial confinement fusion, continues to make progress towards achieving practical fusion power.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What is nuclear fission?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What is nuclear fusion?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: What are some key differences between fission and fusion?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Fission involves the splitting of heavy nuclei into smaller ones, while fusion involves the combining of light nuclei to form a heavier one. Fission releases energy by breaking apart nuclei, while fusion releases energy by combining nuclei. Fission can be controlled for energy generation, while controlled fusion reactions are still being developed.</p>
