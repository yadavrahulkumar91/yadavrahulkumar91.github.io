        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Biot-Savart's law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that relates the magnetic field produced by a steady current to the current element. It provides a mathematical expression for calculating the magnetic field at a point due to a small segment of a current-carrying wire. Biot-Savart's law is essential for understanding the behavior of magnetic fields generated by current-carrying conductors and plays a crucial role in various applications in electromagnetism. In this section, we will explore the principles, equations, and applications of Biot-Savart's law.
