        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Electromagnetic induction is a phenomenon in which an electromotive force (emf) or voltage is induced in a conductor when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field. This fundamental principle of electromagnetism, discovered by Michael Faraday and later mathematically formulated by James Clerk Maxwell, forms the basis for various technologies, including generators, transformers, and induction coils. Understanding electromagnetic induction is crucial for comprehending the generation and transmission of electric power, as well as the functioning of many electrical devices. Let's explore electromagnetic induction in more detail.

        <h2>Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
        <p>
            Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the magnitude of the induced emf in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing through the conductor. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <p class="equation">
            emf = -N(dΦ/dt)
        </p>
        <p>
            where emf is the electromotive force induced in the conductor (measured in volts), N is the number of turns in the conductor, and (dΦ/dt) represents the rate of change of magnetic flux through the conductor. The negative sign indicates that the induced emf creates a current that opposes the change in magnetic flux.
        </p>

        <h2>Lenz's Law</h2>
        <p>
            Lenz's law, derived from Faraday's law, states that the direction of the induced current in a conductor is such that it opposes the change in magnetic field or magnetic flux that produced it. This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy, as the induced current generates a magnetic field that opposes the change in the original magnetic field. Lenz's law provides a helpful rule to determine the direction of the induced current in various situations.

        <h2>Applications of Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
        <p>
            Electromagnetic induction has numerous practical applications, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electric Generators: Electromagnetic induction is used in generators to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Rotating coils of wire are exposed to a changing magnetic field, inducing an emf that generates electric power.</li>
            <li>Transformers: Transformers utilize electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of alternating current (AC) electrical energy. They consist of primary and secondary coils that are magnetically coupled, allowing for efficient voltage transformation.</li>
            <li>Induction Coils: Induction coils, also known as Tesla coils, are used to produce high-voltage, high-frequency alternating currents. They rely on electromagnetic induction to create a rapidly changing magnetic field, inducing a voltage in a secondary coil.</li>
            <li>Wireless Charging: Electromagnetic induction is employed in wireless charging systems, where an alternating magnetic field induces an emf in a receiver coil, allowing for the wireless transfer of electrical energy.</li>
        </ul>
