        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Permittivity is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that describes the ability of a material to store electrical energy in the presence of an electric field. It plays a crucial role in the study of capacitors, dielectric materials, and the behavior of electric fields in different media. Understanding permittivity is essential in various applications, including electronic devices, telecommunications, and electrical engineering. In this section, we will explore the definition, types, and significance of permittivity.

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the key concepts related to permittivity is essential. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electric Field and Electric Displacement: The electric field represents the force experienced by a unit charge, while the electric displacement is defined as the flux of the electric field through a given area.</li>
          <li>Polarization: In the presence of an external electric field, dielectric materials undergo polarization, resulting in the separation of charges and the creation of an electric dipole moment.</li>
          <li>Dielectric Constant: The dielectric constant, also known as relative permittivity, is a measure of how easily a material can be polarized compared to a vacuum.</li>
          <li>Permittivity of Free Space: The permittivity of free space, denoted by ε₀, is a fundamental constant representing the permittivity of a vacuum.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Types of Permittivity</h2>
        <p>
          Permittivity can be classified into two main types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Absolute Permittivity (ε): Absolute permittivity is a material-specific property that quantifies the ability of a material to store electrical energy in an electric field.</li>
          <li>Relative Permittivity (εᵣ): Relative permittivity, also known as the dielectric constant, compares the permittivity of a material to that of a vacuum.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Significance and Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Permittivity has significant implications and applications in various fields, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Capacitors: Permittivity determines the capacitance of capacitors, which store electrical energy in the form of electric fields.</li>
          <li>Dielectric Materials: Permittivity influences the behavior of electric fields in dielectric materials, allowing for increased energy storage and reduced interference.</li>
          <li>Wave Propagation: Permittivity affects the speed of electromagnetic wave propagation in different materials, influencing telecommunications and signal transmission.</li>
          <li>Antennas and Microwave Technology: Permittivity plays a critical role in the design and performance of antennas, microwave devices, and wireless communication systems.</li>
        </ul>
