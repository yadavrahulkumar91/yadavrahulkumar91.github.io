        <h1>Equilibrium of Forces</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In physics, equilibrium refers to a state where the net force acting on an object is zero. When an object is in equilibrium, it can either be at rest (static equilibrium) or moving with a constant velocity (dynamic equilibrium). Understanding the concept of equilibrium is crucial for analyzing the balance of forces acting on an object.</p>
      
        <h2>Conditions for Equilibrium</h2>
        <p>An object is in equilibrium if the following conditions are met:</p>
      
        <h3>First Condition: Net Force is Zero</h3>
        <p>The vector sum of all the forces acting on the object must be zero:</p>
        <p>$\sum F = 0$</p>
      
        <h3>Second Condition: Net Torque is Zero (for rotational equilibrium)</h3>
        <p>If the object can rotate, the net torque acting on the object must be zero:</p>
        <p>$\sum \tau = 0$</p>
      
        <h2>Types of Equilibrium</h2>
        <p>Equilibrium can be categorized into two types: static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium.</p>
      
        <h3>Static Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>An object is in static equilibrium when it is at rest and the net force acting on it is zero. In static equilibrium, the forces acting on the object balance each other out, resulting in no overall motion.</p>
      
        <h3>Dynamic Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>An object is in dynamic equilibrium when it is moving with a constant velocity and the net force acting on it is zero. In dynamic equilibrium, the forces acting on the object are balanced, allowing it to maintain a steady motion without acceleration.</p>
      
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the concept of equilibrium:</p>
        <p>Example: A book is placed on a table. The weight of the book is 10 N, acting vertically downward. The table exerts an upward normal force of 10 N on the book. Determine if the book is in equilibrium.</p>
        <p>Since the weight of the book is balanced by the normal force exerted by the table, the net force on the book is zero. Therefore, the book is in equilibrium.</p>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: What are the conditions for equilibrium?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The conditions for equilibrium are that the net force acting on an object must be zero and, for rotational equilibrium, the net torque acting on the object must also be zero.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What is the difference between static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium?</h3>
            <p>Answer: Static equilibrium refers to a state where an object is at rest and the net force acting on it is zero. Dynamic equilibrium, on the other hand, refers to a state where an object is moving with a constant velocity and the net force acting on it is zero.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: Explain the concept of equilibrium with an example.</h3>
            <p>Answer: Consider a book placed on a table. The weight of the book acts downward, and the table exerts an upward normal force on the book. If the weight and the normal force are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, the net force on the book is zero, and the book is in equilibrium.</p>
