        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Magnetic flux is a concept in electromagnetism that measures the quantity of magnetic field passing through a given surface. It plays a crucial role in understanding electromagnetic phenomena and has practical applications in various areas.</p>
      
        <h2>Definition of Magnetic Flux</h2>
        <p>Magnetic flux, denoted by the symbol Φ, is defined as the product of the magnetic field strength (B) and the area (A) perpendicular to the magnetic field:</p>
        <p class="math">Φ = B × A</p>
        <p>The SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb), which is equivalent to tesla-square meter (T·m²).</p>
      
        <h2>Flux Through a Surface</h2>
        <p>The magnetic flux passing through a surface can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
        <p class="math">Φ = ∫ B · dA</p>
        <p>where B is the magnetic field vector, dA is an infinitesimal area vector, and the integral is taken over the entire surface.</p>
      
        <h2>Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
        <p>One of the significant applications of magnetic flux is in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. According to this law, a change in magnetic flux through a coil of wire induces an electromotive force (emf) across the coil. The magnitude of the induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux:</p>
        <p class="math">ε = -dΦ/dt</p>
        <p>where ε is the induced emf, dΦ/dt is the rate of change of magnetic flux.</p>
