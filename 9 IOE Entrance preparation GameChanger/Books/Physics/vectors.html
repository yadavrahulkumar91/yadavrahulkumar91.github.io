        <h1>Addition and Subtraction of Vectors</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Vectors are mathematical quantities that have both magnitude and direction. In physics, vectors are used to represent various physical quantities such as displacement, velocity, and force. Understanding how to add and subtract vectors is essential for analyzing complex physical phenomena involving multiple forces and motions.</p>
      
        <h2>Addition of Vectors</h2>
        <p>When adding vectors, it is important to consider both their magnitudes and directions. Vectors can be added using the graphical method or the component method.</p>
      
        <h3>Graphical Method</h3>
        <p>In the graphical method, vectors are represented as arrows in a coordinate system. To add vectors graphically:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Draw the first vector as an arrow, indicating its magnitude and direction.</li>
          <li>Draw the second vector, starting from the tip of the first vector, with its magnitude and direction.</li>
          <li>The resultant vector is the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h3>Component Method</h3>
        <p>The component method involves breaking down vectors into their x and y components and then adding the corresponding components separately.</p>
        <p>For example, given two vectors A and B:</p>
        <p>$\vec{A} = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j}$</p>
        <p>$\vec{B} = B_x\hat{i} + B_y\hat{j}$</p>
        <p>The resultant vector $\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$ can be calculated by adding the x components and the y components separately:</p>
        <p>$\vec{R} = (A_x + B_x)\hat{i} + (A_y + B_y)\hat{j}$</p>
      
        <h2>Subtraction of Vectors</h2>
        <p>Subtracting vectors follows a similar approach to adding vectors, but with a slight difference in direction.</p>
        <p>To subtract a vector B from a vector A, we can simply add the negation of vector B to vector A:</p>
        <p>$\vec{R} = \vec{A} - \vec{B} = \vec{A} + (-\vec{B})$</p>
      
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the addition and subtraction of vectors:</p>
        <p>Example: Consider two displacement vectors A and B. A has a magnitude of 5 meters and is directed 30 degrees above the positive x-axis. B has a magnitude of 8 meters and is directed 60 degrees below the positive x-axis. Calculate the resultant displacement vector when A is added to B.</p>
        <p>Using the graphical method:</p>
        <p>Draw vector A with a magnitude of 5 meters and an angle of 30 degrees above the positive x-axis. Draw vector B with a magnitude of 8 meters and an angle of 60 degrees below the positive x-axis. The resultant vector is the vector drawn from the tail of A to the tip of B.</p>
        <p>Using the component method:</p>
        <p>Break down vector A into its x and y components:</p>
        <p>$A_x = A\cos(\theta) = 5\cos(30^\circ)$</p>
        <p>$A_y = A\sin(\theta) = 5\sin(30^\circ)$</p>
        <p>Similarly, break down vector B into its x and y components:</p>
        <p>$B_x = B\cos(\theta) = 8\cos(60^\circ)$</p>
        <p>$B_y = B\sin(\theta) = 8\sin(60^\circ)$</p>
        <p>Add the x components and the y components separately to find the resultant components:</p>
        <p>$R_x = A_x + B_x$</p>
        <p>$R_y = A_y + B_y$</p>
        <p>The resultant displacement vector $\vec{R}$ is given by:</p>
        <p>$\vec{R} = R_x\hat{i} + R_y\hat{j}$</p>
      
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: Explain the graphical method for adding vectors.</h3>
            <p>Answer: In the graphical method, vectors are represented as arrows in a coordinate system. To add vectors graphically, you draw the first vector as an arrow, then draw the second vector starting from the tip of the first vector. The resultant vector is the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: How can vectors be added using the component method?</h3>
            <p>Answer: The component method involves breaking down vectors into their x and y components and then adding the corresponding components separately. The resultant vector is obtained by adding the x components and the y components together.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: How can vectors be subtracted using the component method?</h3>
            <p>Answer: To subtract a vector B from a vector A using the component method, you add the negation of vector B to vector A. This can be done by subtracting the x component of B from the x component of A and subtracting the y component of B from the y component of A.</p>
