  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of conductors and insulators. They play a vital role in modern electronics and are the building blocks of various electronic devices such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits. In this section, we will explore the key properties, behavior, and applications of semiconductors.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Properties</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the key properties of semiconductors is crucial. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Band Structure: Semiconductors have a specific energy band structure. The valence band contains the electrons involved in bonding, while the conduction band is the energy level above the valence band that is vacant or loosely filled.</li>
    <li>Energy Gap: The energy gap, also known as the band gap, is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band. It determines the conductivity of the semiconductor.</li>
    <li>Doping: Semiconductors can be doped by adding impurities to alter their electrical properties. N-type doping introduces extra electrons, while P-type doping introduces holes or vacancies in the valence band.</li>
    <li>Carrier Mobility: Carrier mobility is a measure of how easily charge carriers (electrons or holes) can move through a semiconductor. It affects the conductivity of the material.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Behavior of Semiconductors</h2>
  <p>
    The behavior of semiconductors is influenced by various factors, such as temperature and applied electric fields. Some key aspects of semiconductor behavior include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intrinsic Semiconductor: An intrinsic semiconductor is pure and undoped. Its electrical properties are determined by the intrinsic carrier concentration, which depends on the temperature.</li>
    <li>Extrinsic Semiconductor: Extrinsic semiconductors are doped to modify their conductivity. N-type semiconductors have excess electrons, while P-type semiconductors have excess holes.</li>
    <li>Doping and Majority Carriers: Doping introduces majority carriers (either electrons or holes) that determine the overall conductivity of the semiconductor.</li>
    <li>P-N Junction: A P-N junction is formed by joining a P-type and an N-type semiconductor. It exhibits unique properties such as rectification and the ability to emit or detect light (in the case of LEDs and photodiodes).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    Semiconductors have a wide range of applications in modern technology, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transistors: Transistors are fundamental components of electronic devices. They amplify or switch electronic signals and form the basis of digital logic circuits.</li>
    <li>Integrated Circuits: Integrated circuits (ICs) are made up of thousands or millions of interconnected semiconductor devices on a single chip. They are used in computers, smartphones, and many other electronic devices.</li>
    <li>Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs): LEDs are semiconductor devices that emit light when a current passes through them. They are used in displays, lighting, and indicators.</li>
    <li>Solar Cells: Solar cells convert sunlight into electrical energy using the photoelectric effect in semiconductors. They are a key technology for harnessing renewable energy.</li>
    <li>Diodes: Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow in one direction only. They are used in rectification, voltage regulation, and signal demodulation.</li>
  </ul>
