        <h1>Newton's Laws of Motion</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Newton's laws of motion are fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. Understanding these laws is crucial for analyzing and predicting the motion of objects in various scenarios. This chapter explores the three laws proposed by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
      
        <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
        <p>Newton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.</p>
        
        <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
        <p>Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>$F = ma$</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$F$ is the net force acting on the object</li>
          <li>$m$ is the mass of the object</li>
          <li>$a$ is the acceleration of the object</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>
        <p>Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.</p>
        
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's work through an example to understand the application of Newton's laws of motion:</p>
        <p>Example: A car of mass 1000 kg is initially at rest. A constant force of 5000 N is applied to it. Calculate the acceleration of the car using Newton's second law.</p>
        <p>Given:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mass of the car (m) = 1000 kg</li>
          <li>Net force acting on the car (F) = 5000 N</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using Newton's second law:</p>
        <p>$F = ma$</p>
        <p>Solving for acceleration (a):</p>
        <p>$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{5000}{1000} = 5 \, \text{m/s²}$</p>
        <p>Therefore, the acceleration of the car is 5 m/s².</p>
        
        <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 1: State Newton's first law of motion.</h3>
            <p>Answer: Newton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will continue in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 2: What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration according to Newton's second law?</h3>
            <p>Answer: According to Newton's second law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as $F = ma$.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Question 3: Explain Newton's third law of motion.</h3>
            <p>Answer: Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.</p>
