        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Coulomb's Law is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the electrostatic interaction between charged particles. It quantifies the force between two charged objects based on their charges and the distance between them.</p>
      
        <h2>Statement of Coulomb's Law</h2>
        <p>Coulomb's Law states that the force between two charged objects is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p class="math">F = k * (|q<sub>1</sub>| * |q<sub>2</sub>|) / r<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>where F is the electrostatic force, k is the electrostatic constant (also known as Coulomb's constant), q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between the centers of the charged objects.</p>
      
        <h2>Properties of Coulomb's Law</h2>
        <p>Coulomb's Law exhibits the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Inverse Square Law:</b> The force between two charges decreases with the square of the distance between them. Doubling the distance reduces the force to one-fourth of its original value.</li>
          <li><b>Superposition Principle:</b> The total force on a charged object due to multiple charges is the vector sum of the individual forces between the object and each charge.</li>
          <li><b>Direction:</b> The force between charges is along the line joining their centers and acts in either an attractive or repulsive manner, depending on the charges' signs.</li>
          <li><b>Proportionalities:</b> The force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Units and Electrostatic Constant</h2>
        <p>The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C), and the SI unit of distance is the meter (m). The electrostatic constant, k, is approximately equal to 8.988 × 10<sup>9</sup> N·m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup>.</p>
